1000,"Gender disparities persist in how men and women divide paid work, housework and childcare responsibilities. Despite rising levels of education and labor force participation among women, they continue to perform a larger portion of paid work and childcare compared to their male partners. This gendered division of labor remains prevalent, even as traditional views on gender roles have declined in postindustrial economies (Grunow et al., 2018). While women have increasingly entered the workforce in the past decades, this shift has not been met with a corresponding increase in men’s contribution to household tasks, particularly in childcare. Scholars have reviewed theoretical approaches to explain these continuing disparities. Using the concept of gender ideology as an analytical heuristic tool, we propose a theoretical model to explore support"
1001,"Climate change mitigation cannot occur without significant behavioural change. In the tourism context, therefore, attention has shifted towards developing and empirically testing behavioural change interventions that can trigger more pro-environmental tourist behaviour. Over the past decade, research on environmentally significant tourist behaviour focused mainly on the association of cognitive constructs and pro-Environmental behaviour, much in line with key theories of human behaviour, which assume that attitudes play a key role in driving behaviour. However, evidence is mounting, however, that attitudes may not in fact be as effective as is generally assumed. The aim of the present critical review is to determine (1) whether indeed the current understanding of drivers of environmentally sustainable tourism behaviour is dominated by attitudes (research question #1), (2"
1002,"Employee testimonials are personal narratives by current employees, published by organizations, that explain why they value working for the organization, what drives them in their work and how they experience the company culture. These narratives have a double goal: on the one hand, as cultural standards, they promote a type of professional conduct, expected of current and future employees. On the other hand, by using real employers, organizations attempt to humanize their organization. This allows them to tackle the problem of inauthenticity that is often attached to corporate branding (Maagaard, 2014), making the enterprise less impersonal and more attractive. In particular, the focus is on the case of multinational employers (N: 37), i.e."
1003,"Despite the importance of the concept of “common knowledge,” sociologists have done surprisingly little to theorize it or to explore it empirically. The most significant progress in this direction was made by interactionist sociology in the 1960s, namely, in Morris Friedell’s (1969) analysis of the distribution of situation awareness, where he introduced the formal definition of common knowledge, and in the studies of ‘face’ (1955; 1967; Pinker, 2007: 418-421), “consensus” (1967; 2005), and the awareness of dying (1969). Since then, however, relatively little has been done to develop this line of thinking, and none have attempted"
1004,"This study explores how childbirth is associated with parents planetary concerns (i.e., “environmental and climate concerns”), focusing on Germany, a high-income country with a generous welfare state with a high level of environmental and climate-friendly policies. Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-economic Panel-1984-2020 (GSOEP, 1984-2020), we analyze the association of interest, focusing on within-individual changes before and after childbirth. We consider childbirth as an ongoing process rather than a single point-in-time event, commonly focusing on the average changes shortly after childbirth (Thomas et al., 2018) or in the year preceding it (Milfont, 2020). By exploring parent s�"
1005,"Since 2013, roughly 3 million people have sought humanitarian refuge in Germany, and immigration and integration topics prominently made it back to the political agenda. Researchers and policy-makers have shown increasing interest in factors that determine the social and economic participation of refugees in the receiving context. Particularly labor market participation as a major indicator for structural integration is prominently discussed. The factors identified by scholarly literature contributing to their participation outcomes concern individual factors before migration (such as educational background and job experience), individual factors after migration (e.g. housing or family situation) as well as the institutional context in the destination region. While a large range of literature exists on post-migration factors of integration (Kosyakova and Kogan, 2022), contradicting"
1006,"The Fit for 55 package is designed to prepare the way for EU climate neutrality in 2050. The package includes a series of proposals to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, in addition to binding the goal of climate neutrality to 2050. It comes with potentially significant investment requirements and costs that urge pursuing the most cost-effective policies. A recent study found that several aspects could further improve the cost-effectiveness of current EU climate policies"
1007,"The Australian Jewish identity in literature is a reflection of the process and relationships in society in terms of races within the national boundary and beyond. It has been bestowed an interesting peculiarity as being a challenge to and an amalgamation of the literary currents from the two major Anglophone Jewish contexts, the American and the British, along with its reflection on the geographical closeness and mutual influence with the south Asian context. Among the main Australian literature themes are identity, compensation with the past, psychological and spiritual complexity and the relationship between text/ language and context/ land (Bird, 2000; Huggan, 2007; &amp; Pierce 2009). In this study, the scope is limited to the periphery of the secular and Jewish characters"
1008,"In the last two decades, mass incarceration has become a global reality. Since 2000, the worldwide penal population has increased by around 24%, slightly lower than the increase in the world's population (28%) during that period. The population imprisoned in Latin America and the Caribbean reached 1.5 million in 2020, with a rate of 262 people per 100,000 inhabitants (Alvarado, Mar, Jarqu´ ın, Cedillo, &amp; Forero, 2020). The case of Chile is uncommon, not only it records lower levels of violence than other countries in the region but also follows a predominantly penal populist agenda. According to the World Prison Brief online database, its prison population rate, in July 2022,"
1009,"Degrowth is a heterodox approach to economic growth that challenges mainstream orthodox economics. The concept of degrowth has emerged as a radical alternative to capital accumulation, challenging the current growth paradigm. This review analyses existing literature reviews on degrowth and post-growth research, mapping the complex terrain of literature reviews within the field. We examine the state and quality of evidence synthesis in degrowth research and post growth research, as well as how these reviews contribute to our understanding of social-ecological transformation. Methodologically, we employ a rigorous and systematic approach that follows best practices in evidence synthesis such as the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE 2018), ROSES (Haddaway et al., 2018), and PRISMA ("
1010,"Workers in large, dense metropolitan areas have higher wages than in smaller cities or rural areas. On average, the largest urban and highest-income areas, often dubbed 'Superstar' city-regions, have a higher share of college-educated workers than their respective national economies. But in addition, college educated workers in particular are paid more in bigger, denser cities than they are in smaller ones, giving them a large 'urban wage premium'"
1011,"In this article, we examine the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which was first released in 2018 and then updated in 2019 and 2020 (Federal Highway Administration, 2020; WeStat, 2019). We focus on the interrelated variations in travel modes, trip frequency, trip distance, and vehicle ownership, and their differences across different income levels as well as home ownership, ethnicity, gender, age, and life-cycle classifications. The most noticeable trend in Americans’ travel behavior over the past decade is the peak and decline in the popularity of private automobile travel (Tables 1-2). According to journey-towork data from the recent decennial census and the American Community Survey, the share of Americans"
1012,"In this article, we examine the relationship between genetic influences and educational attainment in Germany, focusing on gender inequality in the 20th century. Genetic effects capture the association between specific genetic variants and an outcome, as identified through large genome-wide association studies. In this literature, genetic effects serve as proxy indicators of equality of opportunity, reflecting the extent to which differences in individuals’ ability to attain social positions like educational attainment are shaped by genetic variation rather than family background or ascribed characteristics such as gender or race. Previous studies have examined the effects of rapid social transformations following the collapse of the Soviet Union on gender inequalities, with a specific focus on gender disparities in the United States. In Germany, we extend previous research by analyzing previous"
1013,"Gender equality is a fundamental value in contemporary societies, which expect all genders to be treated equally. This principle should ensure equal participation in the labor market, political life, and private relationships; however, numerous gender disparities persist. The #MeToo movement highlighted many of these inequalities, demanding greater equality, emancipation, and empowerment, and in doing so, politicized the concept of gender in several European countries. In particular, anti-gender and antifeminist actors mobilized against a socalled “gender ideology” influencing gender politics and debates both online and offline in various countries in the Global North. Social media is a key channel through which conflicts over gender relations are expressed (Barberá, 2020; Benkler et"
1014,"A considerable amount of contemporary cultural and political debate in the United States is over the interpretation and recognition of “rights,” or that to which Americans are morally and legally entitled as human beings (in the case of human rights) or citizens (Hoffman 2012; Mencken and Froese 2019; Gran 2021). Research seeking to explore how and why differences of interpretation or understanding of these ‘rights’ among Americans has consistently identified cultural framing and group centrism as salient factors. Among the leading factors shaping how Americans evaluate what they consider to be rights or which rights they prioritize –specifically those framed as issues concerning individual liberty or minority protection- including political partisanship and educational attainment, is religion (B"
1015,"People with disabilities are employed at far lower rates than people without disabilities. When recessions occur, they typically experience a sharper decline in employment, and during economic recoveries, their employment typically recovers more slowly. Recent analyses, however, have indicated that the covid recession and recovery were different: that employment among people with disabilities declined only proportionately when covid hit and recovered faster than it did among people"
1016,"Archaeological journals have been the subject of much debate in recent years, particularly in the field of archaeology. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of 20 archaeology journals to examine the differences in the hardness of their articles. The results show that the Journal of Archaeological Science (JAS) is one of the most hard-to-read archaeological journals, while the Archaeological Practice Journal (APA) is among the most soft-science. The PCA results also show that archaeology is a discipline with distinct communities of practice, which are very close together on the hard-soft spectrum, but have minor differences in their communication styles, perhaps due to differences in writing traditions inherited from parent disciplines such as ge"
1017,"In the past decades, many countries have attempted to make voting more convenient and less costly for their citizens, for instance by introducing expanded opportunities for early in-person voting, or ballot submission by mail or proxy. The central idea behind these convenience reforms is that lower barriers to voting will lead to a larger and more socially representative electorate (Gronke et al. 2008). But do these policies actually have the desired effect? Whereas most scholars seem to agree that the enactment of various convenience reforms are likely to raise overall turnout, the alleged equalizing impact of these reforms has been subject to debate. In this study, we seek to shed new light on this important debate using Swedish data to examine the extent to which different socioeconomic groups take advantage"
1018,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on work and family life, particularly through the prolonged closure of childcare facilities, schools and businesses, which blurred the boundaries between these spheres. Evidence suggests that this sudden need for reorganisation disproportionately affected women, reinforcing gender inequalities in the division of paid and unpaid work (Hipp and Bünning, 2021; Liu and Gan, 2024; Zoch et al., 2021). Relatedly, the decline in life, family and work satisfaction was more pronounced for women than for men"
1019,"Key performance indicators (KPIs) have been adopted as effective informational policy instruments for sustainability improvement. Nevertheless, the numerous studies conducted to evaluate the impact of sustainability KPIs have highlighted their minimal influence on policy and sustainability change. Up until now, these studies have been conducted using linear methods of analysis that neglect to consider the complexity of governance and policymaking in this field. The complexity stems from acknowledging that the use of these KPIs does not follow an undisturbed, linear trajectory that leads to policy change; instead, its trajectory is messy, resulting from multiple interactions with the various components that affect the policy system. Therefore, a better understanding that accounts for such complexities is needed. We present a complexity-informed methodology, that adopts"
1020,"In this paper, I address long-term trends in intergeneraƟonal persistence of child mortality in the Netherlands between 1835-1919. In this period, levels of child deaths fell from around 365 to 117 deaths per 1000 live-born infants (see Figure 1). Changes in the degree of intergenerational persistence in child mortality throws light on a crucial indicator of the populaƟon’s living standard, the capacity of families to keep their children alive and inequality therein over"
1021,"Sri Lanka is ranked in the “Emerging” band of the Global Care Policy Index (GCPI) with a total score of 3.42. Sri Lanka’s performance in Sub-Index A was significantly lower than Sub- Index B, with a score of 4.42 out of a possible 5."
1022,"The number of people in prisons in England and Wales is at an all-time high. As of 1 March 2024, the prison population stood at 88,133: 5% higher than 12 months ago (83,990; Ministry of Justice, 2024). The prison population is projected to grow even further to between 94,600 and 105,800 by 2028. At the same time, the number of prison staff has shrunk. In 2023, over half (54%) of the 2,978 prison officers who left the service had been in the role for less than three years, and almost one third (31%)"
1023,"There is a systemic connection between data, knowledge, and technology. Data can be seen as the raw material that is used to create knowledge and inform policy decisions. Technology also plays a key role in the implementation of public policy, as it represents the application of knowledge and understanding to the development of tools, systems, and processes that enable individuals to achieve specific goals or solve problems. The growth of data technology has been particularly exponential in recent decades, due in large part to digital technologies. The rapid growth in the volume of data being generated and stored has given rise to the concept of big data, which refers to the large volumes of structured and unstructured data that are generated by individuals, organizations, and devices. Big data is characterized by"
1024,"Crises and uncertainty are often associated with both lower fertility preferences and a decline in births. As crises become more frequent and fertility levels remain low or ultra-low, promoting fertility resilience is likely to increase in importance. Here, we examine how two recent major crises – the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – were associated with self-reported changes in fertility preferences of adults in Finland, a high-income European welfare state. We utilize both quantitative and qualitative data from a representative Family Barometer survey conducted in Finland in August 2022 (Sorsa et al., 2022). For each crisis, respondents were asked whether the crisis changed their fertility preferences. Those who reported any change where further asked"
1025,"The need to belong is a fundamental human motivation that, when realized, is associated with positive emotions, improved health, and enhanced self-efficacy. Conversely, the absence of a sense of attachment to a group has been linked to such outcomes as anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation (Baumeister and Leary, 1995; Waller, 2021). Although the need to belonging transcends social groups, it is especially salient in the workplace, where the failure to experience it can also have adverse consequences for an individual’s job engagement and mental health (Cockshaw et al., 2013; Follmer and"
1026,"Cambodia scored 3.80 out of 10 for its overall GCPI performance, placing it in the “Emerging” Band of the Global Gender Gap Index (GCPI 2020). The Kingdom of Cambodia is a lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The country has yet to ratify the ILO’s Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189) and has made only minimal efforts to protect the rights of local domestic workers. Employment laws have failed to introduce paternity leave and dependent care policies, which further places the burden of unpaid carework on women. As for those who take up waged domestic work, the sector's informality and"
1027,"The number of English-language research articles on political polarization has increased from fewer than 50 per year before 2006 to over 500 per year in 2022 and 2023 , reflecting a growing interest in this phenomenon of researchers, pundits, and the broader public. One line of research on polarization hopes to identify its potential positive consequences: increased political participation. Engagement in politics is a cornerstone of democracy, and a change in the level of participation and the composition of election and protest participants may have profound consequences for future democratic governance. Recognizing its importance, researchers have increasingly taken up this topic in a rigorous way. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis aims to survey this growing literature, identify main theoretical mechanisms and analytic approaches, and summarize its empirical findings"
1028,"The article “Does science have a bullying problem” ( Else, 2018) is one of the most important articles on bullying in recent years. The article’s last lines make compelling reading: “ And the policies must apply regardless of whether the bully is a vice-president or grounds workers"", says Hollis. Universities and institutions in the UK are reported to have more bullying incidents than in the US . It is mentioned that august bodies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the U.S. do not list bullying in their anti-harassment policies. I do think that academic science is a breeding ground for toxic dynamics, mainly because lab"
1029,"Alternative news sources have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly among right-wingers who are often distinguished by their extreme political views, low degree of trust in established mainstream news sources, and Manichean view of politics. While existing research has investigated both the style and content of alternative news and the views of their users, such as the level of political interest and party preferences, other predictors of alternative News consumption have been scrutinized less thoroughly. This article examines alternative news consumption in Germany by combining digital behavioral data with survey data for a fuller picture of individual news consumption. The findings show that alternative news users rely on a mix of alternative and mainstream news, with one element constitutive being an incendiary and polarizing style of"
1030,"This article examines the knowledge and ignorance produced in the process of categorising the sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) of asylum claimants. We use a queer theoretical approach to critique the narrow identity categories applied within asylum law. We find that the onus is primarily on practitioners and decisionmakers to retain a critical awareness and scepticism towards categories; given the circumstances in which asylum claims are made, it cannot be expected that claimants themselves can, will or should challenge the structures of the asylum system or its role in the articulation and regulation of identity."
1031,"In an era of rapid technological advancement, shifting job markets, and evolving societal needs, higher education institutions face the critical challenge of ensuring their curricula remain relevant and responsive. The concept of responsive curricula, which refers to educational programmes that dynamically align with the changing demands of society and industry, has gained significant traction in recent years (Oliver &amp; Hyun, 2011). This approach to curriculum design and implementation is essential for preparing graduates who can navigate the complexities of the modern world and contribute meaningfully to their fields. As such, faculties of economics and business are at the forefront of efforts to develop and implement responsive"
1032,"Aquaculture is now a key contributor to global food security and nutrition, producing near equal amounts of seafood as capture fisheries. However, many questions remain regarding its sustainability. A main challenge is analyzing the underlying drivers of a highly diverse sector with marine, brackish and freshwater geographies, each with unique culturing techniques and environmental dependencies. Aquaculture production systems are not isolated but embedded within local ecosystems, cultures, markets and governance structures, many of which were established to serve the capture fishery and agriculture sectors. At least 39 countries now produce more from aquaculture than they do from capture fisheries, but the global distribution of production is highly skewed towards Asia."
1033,"Industrial policymaking, defined as ‘any targeted government intervention aimed at developing or supporting specific domestic firms, industries, or economic activities’ (Evenett et al., 2024), involves political choices and trade-offs at the executive level, given its stated intention to alter economic behaviour and to enhance the fortunes of some firms and industries over others. While seemingly technical on the surface, these choices can have far-reaching distributive implications, as they hinge on taxation and spending powers (including tax credits and subsidies). In representative democracies with checks on executive policy making, industrial policymakers should therefore be held accountable by majoritarian institutions, particularly by the legislative branch (Crum, 2018). The European Commission, as one of the quasi"
1034,"South Africa performed well in the GCPI compared to most Upper Middle-Income Countries with a total score of 6.24 (out of 10.00), which places it in the “Maturing” index band. It scored 5.93 (out"
1035,"Dobbs v. Jackson (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade (1973) and placed abortion policy under a bright and hot political spotlight once again. Pew Research Center data indicate that a majority of the national public did not approve of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs (see also Gallup July 7, 2023). However, this counter-majoritarian ruling from a set of unelected elites places the legality of abortion back into the hands of elected officials-with the short-term outcome being widely varying state-to-state policy."
1036,"Studies exploring the social antecedents of pornography use among adolescents have consistently found that youth who view pornography more frequently often report experiencing weak or troubled family relationships. While some scholars argue that weaker family ties might encourage pornography use by leaving the door open for unwanted exposure from friends or forms of “deviant” sexual exploration due to loss of social control, others suggest part of the appeal of pornography"
1037,"Following the 'normative turn' in innovation policy in addressing urgent societal challenges (Schlaile et al. 2017; Uyarra et al., 2019), 'directionality' has become a key concept. The notion of “directionality” is not only employed in the innovation policy discourse, but also in sustainability transitions research, where it is related to the normative direction of transformative change processes. While inherently related, the ways the concept of directionality are used in these literature streams suggests the need for distinguishing between ‘systemic directionality’ and “giving direction”, as they seem to hold different meanings."
1038,"Visitation estimates are critical for informing a wide range of questions about how to effectively manage public lands – from quantifying the economic contributions of outdoor recreation (BEA 2023, NPS 2023), to the impacts of diminished air quality (Keiser et al. 2018), and events like oil spills and wildfires on park and beach usage (Tourangeau 2017, Gellman 2022). As a result, most developed countries spend considerable resources developing sampling designs and counting visitors on public lands. While these programs produce incredibly valuable data, the logistical challenges and expense of counting visitors using on-the-ground methods means monitoring programs rarely produce consistent and comprehensive estimates, leading to pleas for more and better data, from management agencies, academics"
1039,"Humans face major environmental challenges, including climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation, and plastic pollution. These challenges began to be widely recognized from the 1960s to the 1980s through seminal work in environmentalism, including “Silent Spring” (Carson, 1962) and “The Limits to Growth’ (Meadows et al., 1972). The mainstream response has been further advancing scientific knowledge and technology. As consequence, educational curricula in most countries now include environmental science. However, environmental challenges have worsened over the past several decades and are projected to continue this trajectory (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 2021). This suggests a need to explore alternative approaches. One alternative approach, termed the “cultural"
1040,"A vast and growing literature studies agency problems lurking behind politician-bureaucratic interactions. We contribute to this literature by focusing on two key aspects that are relatively understudied. One involves the third party in our case being uninformed about who was actually responsible for the policy outcome. The other is that the principal in our approach also cares about their reputation. In our setup, the principal is typically an elected representative with a greater ability to communicate to the outside world than the agent. The agent is the bureaucrat who delivers the policies the principal wishes to execute. We distinguish ourselves in two ways. One, in Glazer and Segendorff (2005) there is a probability that an untruthful credit claim is"
1041,"Material wealth inequality has emerged as a fundamental characteristic of human social organisation. It has been identified as one of the most significant drivers of inequality in human history, and has emerged in multiple cultural and ecological settings, often with major impacts on life outcomes. In this paper, we examine the relationship between material and relational wealth, and examine how the study of social networks can shed light on the differing associations between relational and terial wealth, which might exacerbate or mitigate material 30 inequality. Meso-level analysis of interactions and 23 social relationships, typically through network analysis [18, 24 51], provides a useful tool in this regard. We examine the situations where the wealthy chose to associate primarily with one32 another, where"
1042,"In 2020, five Russian universities did not enter the top 100 of global university rankings. The main objective of this article is to provide a thorough understanding of how global rankings are interpreted and understood in Russia. This will be achieved through a rigorous and comprehensive review of the Russian-language academic literature, which will help shed light on the various perspectives and viewpoints emerging from Russia regarding the utilization and interpretation of global rankings. We also highlight the problem from the point of view of global trends. The selection of Russian literature for this study was purposeful and strategic. The focus on Russian literature aligns with the objectives of Project 5top100 flagship excellence initiative (2013-2020) which was heavily influenced by university rankings, the project derived its name"
1043,"The current study investigates the effectiveness of e-learning in teaching and learning-year EFL at Ahmed Salhi University Center, Algeria, during the academic year 2021-2022. The study aims to examine whether e-Learning has enhanced the learners’ English language skills and fluency in Grammar, Oral/Written Comprehension and Expression, and Cognitive Psychology in the first (L1) and second (L2) years of the third-year LicenseMaster-Doctorate (LMD) course. The current study is based on the research conducted at the Naama University Center in Algeria. The research conducted in this context, it aims to illustrate the instructors’ perspectives on adopting an eLearning platform as well"
1044,"This data brief presents the newly published dewiki meetup dataset containing all 4418 meetups that have been organised with information on attendees, apologies, date and place of meeting, minutes recorded, and source information. The dataset covers almost twenty years of offline activity of the German-language Wikipedia. From its launch in 2001 to March 2020 when face-to-face meetings came to a halt due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic, all meetups were collected and can now be easily merged with online activity data. It captures the development of the offline network over time of one of the most sustainable, online public goods and the community producing it. In the typical spirit of Wikipedia, these meetings are organised publicly and"
1045,"In Denmark, more than 30 percent of children can expect to experience a parental divorce or union dissolution during their childhood. Such shocks to family life may drastically alter the home environment and impose new constraints on parents’ time and economic resources. Adverse effects have been identified both in the short- and long run. Yet, due to the complex and non-random nature of divorce (Lyngstad and Jalovaara 2010), strong causal designs have been elusive with most studies adjusting for confounding through either conditioning on observables, matching strategies, latent variable modelling, or sibling fixed effect designs (see McLanahan et al. 2013 for review). Thus, selection issues may persist, especially in the light of evidence on pre-divorce adjustments"
1046,"The Philippines had an overall GCPI score of 7.23 (out of 10) placing it in the higher end of the 'Maturing' Index Band. Its strong performance was buoyed by its high levels of protection for domestic workers and strong maternity leave provisions in Sub-Index A, but is penalized by inadequate dependent care leave and flexible work arrangements. The Philippines has ratified 38 ILO conventions, of which 30 are in force."
1047,"Workplace surveillance has always been a pressing issue for society with the first notable examples originating in the 20th century. The advancement of technology has resulted in the increasing amounts of interest in workplace surveillance (Ball 2022). It has intensified greatly as employers are now able to carry out: “personal data gathering, Internet and email monitoring, location tracking, biometrics and covert surveillance” (Ball 2010: 87). Empirical studies on employee attitudes suggest mixed responses to whether this is a positive or negative practice. One issue with studies on workplace surveillance is that it is experienced on such a subjective, individual level in different forms, so it can be argued that workplace surveillance can cause negative effects, especially with the more intensive forms. This"
1048,"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently offering compensation programs that incentivize farmers to test and monitor their poultry for signs of H5N1 infection. The USDA's ""Defend the Flock"" initiative (APHIS 2024a) provides farmers with guidelines for how to ensure that their flocks are compliant with National Poultry Improvement Plan biosecurity standards, including the disinfection of farm equipment, engaging in state-overseen audits to determine preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks, and monitoring for signs that their poultry are infected. In order to move lactating cattle across state lines, farmers must subject milk samples to rigorous testing from state accredited veterinarians, unless those animals are sent directly to slaughter (in"
1049,"This article explores the current state of oracy in UK higher education and proposes an alternative study practice – “oral essay” – that could provide “space” for composing and practising spontaneous academic oral monologues in higher education. The paper addresses the following questions: Do we have time or patience in contemporary academia to “give students the floor”, to tolerate pauses and speech disfluencies, and to let students practise live construction of ideas in oral tasks? Do we prepare students for spontaneous encounters in their professional life? Can we conceptualise and practise monological oracy not only as a product (conveniently “packed”) for assessment, but also as process – for thinking"
1050,"In recent decades, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become increasingly embedded into young people’s lives and schools’ functioning. Broadband internet coverage is vital for education, as schools are globally transitioning toward hybrid systems that need continuous access to high-quality internet. Yet, the introduction of high-speed internet could also bring educational risks to students. For example, it can increase the chances that adolescents experience attention deficits and sleep disruptions and this may in turn harm students’ academic performance. Providing an answer to this puzzle is essential as societies become increasingly digitalised. In this study, we investigate the effect of the expansion of broadband internet coverage on adolescents’ Academic performance in Norway. We apply a novel"
1051,"Since the dawn of capitalist modernity, the frontier of civilization has been considered as “nature”. Within the modernist perspective, “Nature” functions as ‘the other, the wild, theuntamed, the “non-human”, the past, and “pre-social”"
1052,"This paper investigates the entanglements through which sonic bodies and sonic thinking are intra-actively materialized in the city. Through sonic speculative practices it experiments with the creation of new sonic sensibilities via different material configurations and situated practices. We propose listening as a speculative spatial practice that makes power relations in our urban environment felt, that activates new ways of imagining the city, its inclusions and exclusions; a way of performing urban spaces and its processes differently. We argue that a political and ethical approach to listening includes, on the one hand, a listening-out for the absence of sounds (see LaBelle 2018), on the other hand, an relational mapping that"
1053,"Minimum income schemes (MISs) are last-resort cash payments available to working and non-working households who have insufficient financial means and are not entitled to contributory social insurance. These schemes are becoming increasingly relevant in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ecological transition and the cost-of-living crisis as they can be used to support people who are either temporarily unable to work, who need time to learn new skills or whose wages are insufficient to cover living expenses. Despite the widespread use and relevance of MISs, a consensus does not exist among researchers and policymakers on the effectiveness of these schemes in improving the financial situation of households. In theory, giving cash to households should support them financially. However"
1054,"There is no doubt that emerging technologies will continue to have an impact both positively and negatively on society as they continue to develop. This is in the same way that most changes in our everyday lives have done so. It is impossible for us to predict how this is going to turn out in the long run. The question of how it can be made to work is still open. This means that people will need to think about how they can customize it to suit their needs and lifestyles. According to the author, the changes are a good thing for most people, since he is an optimist. The author, however, believes that there may be some instances where extensive human intervention is required, and"
1055,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among 15-29-year-olds worldwide (World Health Organisation, 2021). People who live in state care, often due to previous child abuse or neglect, have an elevated risk of suicidal ideation, behavior and dying by suicide. Suicidal thoughts and behavior among people with care experience can occur from a young age. During adolescence, teenagers with care"
1056,"Machine Translation (MT) has been used to translate legal texts from Arabic into English. However, Machine Translation Quality Assessment (MTQA) of legal texts has not been studied before to the best knowledge of the researcher. To achieve the objective of the study, the research questions are as follows:– 1) What are the types of errors found in the MT output of legislative texts?– 2) Does MT’s output maintain features of legal discourse?– 3) The study sheds light on the accuracy of MT output"
1057,"In recent years, lifespan inequality has become an important indicator of population health, alongside more established longevity measures. Uncovering the statistical properties of lifespan inequality measures can provide novel insights on the study of mortality developments. We revisit the e † measure, introduced in Vaupel and Canudas-Romo (2003), and introduce the “Average Uneven Mortality” (AUM) index, a novel relative mortality index that can be used to analyze mortality patterns. We explore the behavior of the index across age and over time, and we study its relationship with life expectancy. The index generally increases over age and reduces with increasing values of life expectancy, with differences between the period and cohort perspectives. We also develop"
1058,"The emergence of visual dating platforms has provided an unprecedented public venue for gay men’s open interaction. However, previous studies have mostly focused on gay online dating users’ strategies for visual presentation and the factors that impact the cues in photos on the sender's side (Wu &amp; Ward, 2017). We identify two possible improvements from previous research. First, although existing studies have discussed the exposure of various physical visual cues, they have ignored the presence of background scene cues from photos. Second, the relationship between visual cues and their effects on users' dating popularity remains unclear. In this study, we will address the above gaps by analyzing users' self-representation through their public profiles"
1059,"The scarcity of tenure-track positions for Ph.D. students has resulted in many turning their interest and attention to alternative career opportunities within academia. It is here that universities can play a role by providing resources and developing career opportunities that would benefit from such highly skilled graduates. Such career prospects can range from project grant management to research institute administration. However, the visibility of these career pathways is either not fully apparent or not always encouraged. Even for individuals who have secured tenure-stream positions, there is often little knowledge about how university administration functions. This situation can leave faculty, staff, and students without the necessary awareness or understanding of university environments that support education and research success. Queen's University is well-positioned to provide professional"
1060,"The impact of genes on socioeconomic outcomes is a central focus of research on social inequalities. We argue that this impact should also be at the centre of the debate surrounding equality of opportunity. The Education Act of 1944 in England increased the compulsory schooling of children by one year and ensured free secondary education for all students up to age 15. We implement a regression discontinuity design to exploit the cut-off produced by the reform and use ELSA data, which combines genetic information on individuals’ predisposition towards education, namely the polygenic index for educational attainment (PGI), with measures of socioeconomic outcomes across three dimensions: education, income, and wealth. Results show evidence of a reduction in the association between genes and socioeconomic outcomes due to"
1061,"Protest stickers, as a form of communicative street art, are ubiquitous ephemeral objects that can be viewed, if we choose to 'see' them, mainly in urban areas, especially cities where pedestrianisation is high. The messages that the stickers convey are decoded or interpreted by the viewer (Hansen and Flynn, 2015; Tedford, 2021; Collins, 2022; Bodden and Awcock, 2024). This individualised interaction with and reading of the message is reliant on the text, images, culture and symbols being popular in mainstream discourse, for understanding to be internalised and will already be part of the everyday lexicon of ordinary language of the viewer. Of course, we all possess differing linguistic and"
1062,"Jargon is often berated as a barrier to communicating outside technical communities, but it does have a part to play: it speeds up communication within technical communities. Like all words, jargon is a kind of compression, taking a bundle of meanings and condensing them into something that can be quickly communicated to another, provided this other has significant experience in the same community. However, there is a cost to this hastening. The first emerges when our works are read by “outsiders” if we wish to reach outsiders, they must be inducted into the ways of the community to reduce misunderstandings. The second emerges when we, the writers, proceed as if our readers fully comprehend the jargon of our own technical community"
1063,"Procedural justice emphasizes the importance of fair and respectful interactions throughout a process. It has two intertwined components: the quality of decision-making procedures and quality of treatment. In this paper, we examine whether promoting procedurally just police-citizen interactions can increase public trust in the police. We conducted a randomized experiment with the Colombian National Police-a centralized police force with roughly 170,000 sworn officers-across five cities: Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cali, and Medell"
1064,"This paper presents recurrence mapping as a new visualisation tool for the analysis of exact and inexact repetition in language. It can be used with any type of connected source material, including audio (e.g., full-spectra, f0 contours, etc.) and written data, including transcripts, glosses and translations. Recurrence mapping is related to “dynamic time warping”, but has not so far been used to visualise repetition"
1065,"Reliable estimates of death rates are essential for addressing complex humanitarian emergencies. These estimates are crucial for crisis assessment, resource allocation, preserving the historical record of tragedies, and supporting advocacy. Recent estimates of mortality in humanitarian emergencies have guided effective responses to armed conflicts, famine, and war crimes. The most reliable way to learn about death rates is generally through data from a highquality civil registration and vital statistics system (CRVS). However, this is often not feasible. In this study, we adapt a method called network survival to the challenge of estimating death rates during a complex humanitarian emergency in which operational constraints prevent direct access to populations."
1066,"Since Nigeria’s transition to civilian rule in 1999, it has contended with various groups agitating for the independence of the predominant-Igbo Eastern Region to form the Republic of Biafra. This sentiment is tied to the defunct Republic, which was in existence from May 30, 1967 to January 15, 1970. The secession of the Eastern Region from Nigeria marked the beginning of the Nigerian Civil War, which is also known as the"
1067,"Cognitive impairment is disproportionately higher in rural populations than urban populations. This paper presents the results of the SECHURA study, conducted in 41 Indiana counties between November 2023 and March 2024. Participants were recruited from a preexisting sample that was collected for the Person to Person Health Interview Study (P2P). The P2P is a state representative omnibus health and wellness study fielded from 2018-2021 that used a probability sampling frame to recruit and gather data on 2685 participants (age 18 and over) who resided in 41 counties. Participants completed a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) survey and ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The latter approach leverages smartphone technology that allows participants to respond to questions about"
1068,"The 2024 United States presidential elections, held on November 5, resulted in a significant political shift as Donald J. Trump (Republican) defeated Kamala D. Harris (Democrat) with a decisive electoral vote count of 312 to 226, also winning the popular vote by a margin of 2.6%. The election saw a voter turnout of 63.3%, marking the second highest since 1960, and Trump’s campaign achieved remarkable success by flipping"
1069,"Technological change is changing the work and skill requirements of employees, especially in modern Western societies. This paper examines the impact of technology use in the workplace on participation in further training under the influence of task complexity. The study links theoretical approaches to technological task change and training, identifies disadvantaged groups (policy) and individual and company training strategies can be derived. Overall, it contributes to the literature by examining whether technological change affects training behaviour differently for employees with less complex, more automatable tasks than for those with more complex tasks."
1070,"There are large and persistent racial disparities in fetal and infant outcomes in the United States. Non-Hispanic Black women are more likely to experience stillbirth, premature live birth, or the early death of their child. While these disparities are addressed individually in large literatures in demography, public health, and medicine, there is little prior work that considers them in concert. There is a need to consider the cumulative and compounding risk of multiple potential outcomes in one comprehensive framework, to better understand how risk evolves over the later gestational period for different population groups and how best to target health interventions. In this paper we propose a multiple-decrement life table approach to study fetal"
1071,"Misinformation has emerged as a major problem in society. It has also emerged as the most crucial issue of our time. In response, we introduce the SocioEcological Responses to Misinformation (SERM) framework, a comprehensive framework which integrates existing strategies to combat misinformation in democratic systems. The SERM framework distinguishes between interventions, interventions, and interventions at lower levels (e.g., policy, organizational, and social media) and at higher levels (g.e. policy, social media). It also distinguishes between two key targets: social media platforms and platforms that allow users to create and disseminate content. The framework also identifies three distinct interventions where interventions are implemented: the policy, the social level, and"
1072,"Weather forecasts provide a wide variety of benefits to society, including protecting lives, aiding responses to extreme weather, and improving labor productivity. The value of these benefits is large, with recent estimates of the monetized economic benefits from accurate weather forecasts exceeding multiple times their production costs. This accuracy is routinely assessed by international and national meteorological and hydrological services, but the results are included in technical reports. As a result, little is known about how forecast accuracy is temporally and spatially distributed. Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis of global inequalities in numerical weather predictions. We focus on short-range temperature forecasts that are highly relevant for economic decision making and for adaptation to climate change, especially for the reduction of temperature-related mortality"
1073,"The United States allocates more money to the police than they give food to the homeless. With the current population of the United States resulting in 330 citizens, the U.S policies more than 50 percent of the population, mostly Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC). From this, I developed a Web application that captures the lack of resources given to those in need and tells the story of the need for police abolition. Using data visualization I compared the staunch governmental divide of funding to the"
1074,"In the highly competitive landscape of academia, attaining a tenured full professorship, which is the highest academic rank in many countries, is often considered a main career goal. The German academic system has undergone significant transformations in the new millennium, including new academic pathways based on the Anglo-Saxon science system to make academic careers more transparent and predictable. Yet, little is known about the actual pathways taken by postdoctoral researchers who are successful at attaining the top academic position and about which structural and individual characteristics correlate with the pathway the qualified post doctoral researchers take. With our study, we extend the current body of literature by investigating patterns of academic careers to a successful appointment as full professor-which in Germany is tenured and in"
1075,"Political efficacy is among the strongest predictors of political participation. It is one of two dimensions of political efficacy: internal political efficacy, i.e., perceptions of one’s own ability to understand politics and to become politically involved, and external political efficacy (i.e. the belief in opportunities to influence politics and responsiveness to citizens’ needs and demands) and in the system’reaction or response to these needs. In this paper, we present the results of a cross-national survey of the American National Election Survey (ANES) and the European National Social Survey (ESS) conducted between April and June 2018. We find that people are aware of differences in opportunities in politics and system responsiveness between different groups"
1076,"Mixed-methods approach exploring the role of online group dance as support for young people (aged 16-24) living with anxiety and mental health issues. In this study, we explore whether online group dancing can be used as an alternative to in-person support for mental health and loneliness in young people living with mental health challenges. The findings show that online group dances have a positive effect on the mental health of young people with anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and that they can be accessed online regardless of in person restrictions. In addition, online group activities have been found to have similar effect sizes as cognitive behavioural therapy (e.g., exercise, music, and self-help activities) and social group activities (e"
1077,"In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the United States Supreme Court created an unambiguous personal right to keep and bear arms. Two years later, the Court applied this right to the states in McDonald v. Chicago . The Court came very close to shaking up Second Amendment jurisprudence again in New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Ass’n v. City of New York , though the case was rendered moot at the last second. Given that four justices stated or implied some appetite to review state gun laws, the Second Amendment will likely come before the Court sooner rather than later."
1078,"Many theories predict that the effect of a treatment is not uniform but can differ between groups. These heterogeneous effects can have significant consequences for both empirical research and practical interventions. In regression analysis frameworks, these tests are usually referred to as interactions (sometimes also called moderation). The key idea is that the main effect of the treatment interacts with a subgroup of the sample. In this paper, we introduce a wide range of potential solutions in Stata. We will investigate both continuous and binary outcome variables with a continuous treatment variable and binary groups and conduct a comprehensive simulation study to evaluate both alpha error and statistical power. By doing so, we aim to provide practical recommendations on which approach offers the highest statistical quality."
1079,"Autocrats are theorized to use elections for various purposes ranging from patronage distribution to learning about the public’s preferences and strengthening legitimacy. A central argument in this literature is that elections – and particularly executive elections for the autocrat themselves – signal the autocrats’ strength. How does an election do this? The most obvious component is a landslide victory. Where the candidate wins the election, particularly by overwhelming margins, voters"
1080,"Predicting conflicts has long been a key area of interest for scholars of international relations, conflict researchers, and policy-makers. Given the important role that prediction could play in preventing conflicts and the high stakes associated with it, this longstanding interest is not surprising. However, for a long time, these efforts were limited in their scope through constraints in computational power as well as limited data availability. Hence, early efforts to forecast or predict conflict were mostly limited to strategic analyses of individual cases (see e.g. Raphael, 1982; Azar et al., 1977; de Mesquita et"
1081,"There is a great need to understand which educational programs are effective and under which conditions. Assessing program effectiveness can, however, be complicated due to insufficient commitment to research of stakeholders, a lack of research funding or improper designs for evaluation. As a solution, researchers propose using aggregate school-level datasets to carry out program evaluation in valid, nonintrusive, and cost-effective ways. In this study, we present the evaluation of the efficacy of an extended school week in the Netherlands, using a quasi-experimental design, leveraging unique school- level registry data and synthetic control analysis. The intervention is part of the National Program Rotterdam South, a unique program in its unique scope, long-term orientation and involvement of"
1082,"Research must be conducted transparently and should be reproducible to the extent possible. This emerging consensus is endorsed by funders, required by journals, and supported by researchers across disciplines in the social sciences and beyond. While not without skeptics, the transparency agenda has been widely accepted in quantitative research. Among qualitative researchers, however, transparent research methods and data sharing have been adopted more hesitantly [2-4]. Some of the reservations voiced by qualitative researchers stem from fundamentally different views of the research process and the epistemologies underlying their work [5]. More broadly, though, skepticism about “qualitative transparency” is rooted in a justified unease with applying concepts developed for quantitative research to qualitative work. There is a rich tradition"
1083,"Human trafficking is one of the most pernicious global challenges of the 21st century. Climate change can have a compounding effect on human trafficking, as it has both short and long term impacts on economic development and physical and social infrastructure, especially around the tropics. The impacts of climate change on trafficking patterns, especially as they involve inter- mediary states, need to be understood in the context of how they interact with existing institutions. There has been a rapid diffusion of anti-trafficking laws over the last two decades, with 75% of countries now having adopted such laws, compared to less than 10% that did so before 2000. Yet, the downstream complexities of the diffusion of these laws have yet to be"
1084,"In this paper, the author explores the role of AI nationalism in the development of AI and its consequences. The author uses process tracing and qualitative evidence to describe how some nations nurture AI within their borders, while others restrict access to the building blocks of AI, such as funds, data and high-speed computing power, and export controls for the advanced chips that power many types of AI. To create AI, developers need several elements such as capital, data, human expertise and infrastructure, including high speed computers and the chips which power them, as well as data and infrastructure that power them. In doing so, some governments are excluding foreign firms from access to these components, or requiring local content in the AI supply chain, or adopting"
1085,"There is a well-documented negative correlation between ethnic diversity and public good provision in both developed and developing countries. This might arise from heterogeneity in preferences for types of public goods or a lack of cooperation across ethnic groups. Over the past 50 years, many countries have implemented reforms to decentralize government, which is often perceived as an opportunity to form more homogeneous local jurisdictions and alleviate concerns related to inter-ethnic cleavages. However, it remains an open question whether more ethnically homogeneous jurisdictions actually provide better local public services. This paper investigates a national decentralization policy that occurred in 2013 in Kenya whereby responsibility for many services were devolved to newly created local authorities. One of the most critical sectors affected was healthcare: the new county"
1086,"Tourism generates 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the world, yet only a handful of sustainable tourism approaches have been developed to date. Existing measures to make tourism more environmentally and socially constructive, rather than destructive, are implemented in isolation and, as such, cannot achieve systemic change at the speed required to address the threat of climate change for humanity. We propose a sector-wide approach that has the potential to create system-wide incentives towards regenerative tourism - tourism that not only avoids causing environmental and social harm, but rather improves the social fibre of local communities and contributes to environmental protection. The base mechanism of the proposed approach - called NjATE (which stands for 'not just a token effort' and is pronounced"
1087,"This document presents a proposed research program on the formal demography of kinship and families. This research program develops a general model for kinship networks, outlines directions for extending the model to individuals, cohorts, and populations, and suggests ways in which it can applied to empirical demographic data. It does not, by any means, claim to exhaust all the important questions. It was actually a proposal submitted to the European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant program in the fall of 2017, and awarded for the period 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2024, with the ERC acronym FORMKIN. The results will be applied to a variety of mortality and fertility data (international, national, model life tables, and population register data)."
1088,"Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages are the most linguistically diverse on earth, with the most diverse number of languages by population and area by area (François et al., 2015; 2015; 2016; 2017; 2018; 2019; 2022). Bislama, the national language of Vanuatu, is widely considered to be a “plantation language” used by those that are outcast or who leave their homes, families, and villages to earn cash instead of playing their part in their home communities. It has been described as “insufficient” as a language of the heart, “not a real language,” and “broken English” by Christian missionaries. It"
1089,"English has emerged as a predominant lingua franca globally, significantly influencing communication, commerce, scientific pursuits, and the educational landscape. English has almost 1.5 billion speakers; it is the official language in 76 nations, representing 40% of the global population, and more than 755 million individuals use English as a foreign language. The increasing trend of capitalizing on the advantages of English has numerous practical implications. For instance, English is the predominant language in educational institutions worldwide. Subsequently, English serves as the primary language for numerous global employment recruitment websites (Issa, 2024). The acknowledgement of English can be ascribed to its adaptability, the significant influence of British colonialism, the dominance of the United States (Hein"
1090,"Nigeria is one of the most violent countries in Africa, especially in the Sahel region, where conflicts between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers are common. Between 1997 and 2021, there were 5,799 conflicts in Africa in which at least one party was a pastoralist. These incidents spanned 39 countries and Nigeria alone accounted for 34 percent of them. Among Nigeria's 36 states, Kaduna accounted for 12 percent of the almost 2,000 incidents that occurred in the country during this period, making it the third state most affected by pastoral conflicts. The majority of these conflicts were violent in nature, with 83 percent of"
1091,"As a productive skill, writing is considered a big challenge for students at both school and university levels. Students need help expressing their ideas for many reasons, such as mother language interference, exposure to authentic context, and teachers applying the right approach while teaching this skill. Many studies have proved that the product-based approach to writing does not improve students’ creativity or writing skills (Ghofrun, 2016). Having such challenges and problems, and since technology is being incorporated into ESL teaching, this research claims that using corpora is highly effective and recommended to overcome these issues. To apply this successfully, two academic steps should be considered in parallel. First, the brainstorming stage comprises three stages: the while-writing stage, the"
1092,"Biodiversity globally continues its trajectory of long-term decline1. To change this trend and achieve global conservation goals, societies need to address the global biodiversity funding gap – caused by vast mismatches between the level of investment in nature conservation and restoration, and current spending on conservation and perverse government subsidies that incentivise further declines2–4. Addressing these economic drivers and enablers of biodiversity loss and recovery is central to the Kunming-Montreal Agreement, with Targets 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 all targeting the tackling of harmful subsidies, the need of businesses and financial institutions to assess and address their impacts and dependencies on nature, and upscaling investment. However, mechanisms for attracting private investment into"
1093,"Systematic similarities in socioeconomic outcomes between family members come from two broad types of sources: environmental and genetic. It is well established that genetics play a role in educational attainment, and to some extent for economic outcomes such as income and wealth. However, the role of genetic influences in the attainment of occupation-based measures of class positions has not been systematically tested in neither sociological stratification research nor behavioral genetics, and the research on genetic influences on occupational prestige and status attainment is very limited. Class and status are central to sociological theories of social mobility and are arguably the most important link between educational attainment and economic outcomes. Despite this, we know very little about the extent to which they are influenced by genetics. This is especially true for conceptual"
1094,"In recent decades, sustainability has emerged as a dominant theme in addressing future uncertainties. Consequently, much scholarly attention has focused on management and design, particularly the design of technologies and products. In this paper, we attend to the practices that precede design and focus on basic research in science and engineering-research that lays the foundations for future technologies, designs, and technology-based products. With this focus, we seek to explore how sustainability and basic research can inform one another. We aim to dissect the various meanings of sustainability as they are invoked in the appraisal and evaluation of basic research. More specifically, we pursue the question: What is valued when basic research is deemed “sustainable? To address this question, we draw on qualitative methods"
1095,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, massive anti-government protests have resurged in Germany. These protests mobilized and shared their counter-knowledge via the messenger app Telegram. In addition to researchers, this Telegram protest sphere has been under continuous surveillance also by digital counter-activists, a phenomenon that has yet to receive scholarly attention. These activists frequently shared screenshots from protestors’ Telegram channels and other platforms on X (formerly Twitter). It is this monitorial practice of counterprotest that we focus on here. We conducted eight semi-structured in-depth interviews with German monitoring activist accounts who posted about far-right coronavirus-protest online activities on X. We were mainly driven by the research interest to understand who"
1096,"The Korean peninsula has long been re-shaped by internal conflicts and the influence of larger neighbouring countries. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established between North and South Korea in 1953, after the Korean War. The DMZ is about 4 km wide, and it extends for 250 km across the Korean peninsula. In South Korea, a Civilian Control Zone (CCZ) extends a further 5-20 km south from the DMZ (figure 1). At the end of the Korean war, South Korea was a poor country. In 2024, it is Asia's fourthlargest economy and the world's thirteenth-largest by GDP (Yoo, 2023). This resurgence of nature has transformed the DM"
1097,"Human dispersal into northern latitudes during the last glacial cycle was an impressive feat of adaptation that remains a subject of discussion. Central Asia, with its cold and arid climates, which were exacerbated by Pleistocene climatic oscillations, presents an ideal laboratory for testing hypotheses about the role of human behavior in dispersal under adverse conditions. Here, we propose an evolutionary agent-based model to explore the effect of behavioral adaptation and social dynamics in the ever-changing environments of Central Asia. The model is exposed to different climate scenarios to understand how extreme conditions can affect the cost of maintaining cooperation and the selection of cooperative behavior in extreme climate scenarios, with the aim of understanding the importance of selecting a social strategy for dispersal"
1098,"In the recent years, the term “gender” and several negatively connoted semantic derivatives have been strategically used as polemic catch-all terms. They aim at expressing and inciting generalized resistance to progressive demands and stances regarding gender identity, equality politics, LGBTIQ+ , reproductive 1 rights, gender studies as well as discrimination-sensitive practices and language in a society. Overall, there has not only been intensive political and media debate about the relevance and adequacy of gender issues in modern society. There was also a notable increase in social unrest around diverse gender policies and gender issues. The unrest surrounding gender issues, thus, concerns a panorama of very different policy areas (e.g., fundamental rights, abortion, homosexuality"
1099,"Sweden is the largest Nordic country in Northern Europe with a population of 10.4 million. It is the 16th richest country in the world. Its export-oriented mixed economy has become increasingly dependent upon foreign labor in both high- and low-skilled work with foreigners comprising a quarter of its population. Its model of labor relations largely decentralizes labor regulations to collective bargaining agreements spearheaded by various labor unions. Sweden has ratified 96 ILO conventions and four protocols, of which 67 conventions are in force. These include C156, C143, C189 which relate to carework. However, the Maternity Protection Convention has not been ratified."
1100,"The importance of an education system that includes all learners has been broadly recognized globally (IBE-UNESCO, 2016). There is a growing emphasis in international education policy on the necessity for national education systems to deliver inclusive and equitable education for every student. In response to shifts in international conventions and national education policies, numerous education systems have started to explore how innovative pedagogical approaches can enhance inclusive education practices. The Constructionist, Contextualized, and Meaningful (CCM) approach (Schlünzen, 2020) has gained significant prominence in contemporary education. Its rise is primarily attributed to its strong focus on the contextualized and meaningful construction of knowledge"
1101,"WhatsApp is a free instant messaging application for smartphones initially made available on the iPhone in 2009, and available on other operating systems, most notably Android, from 2010. It allows users to send text messages as well as images, video, files, and audio messages to other users of the app via the internet. While other web and desktop interfaces are also available besides the smartphone app, in principle a WhatsApp account is connected to a phone number. Users can message any other user who is in their phone’s contact list. In contrast to typical social media platforms, WhatsApp does not feature publicly searchable profile pages of users, nor does it allow users to view and traverse connections of other users."
1102,"Neanderthal populations in Eurasia have consistently been structured by geographic changes. We see a new, and genetically distinct, connection between European and Siberian Neanderthals dated between 110-70 ka during MIS 5; first documented in the genetic similarities between the Mezmaiskaya and Chagyrskaya fossils (Mafessoni et al., 2020), and now confirmed by ancient DNA from several caves in Europe and Siberia. Despite the genetic evidence for multiple long-distance dispersals across Eurasia, we still have limited knowledge about the possible routes they would have taken to get to Siberia and the behavioral adaptations required for that journey. Here, we use an agent-based least cost path (AB-LCP) approach to more"
1103,"Research Engagement (RE) is paramount in elevating Research productivity (RP), determining a country’s international standing, and bolstering innovation capabilities in higher education, especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) fields, such as English Education, which consistently shows lower publication outcomes than other fields of study like natural science, technological engineering, and life science medicine (Haqiyah, et al., 2021). English Education Departments are notably absent from the top ten departments with the highest research productivity at the national level. This discrepancy highlights a critical issue: the need to enhance research engagement and research productivity in Indonesia across all educational sectors, especially private universities whose research productivity was not outstanding compared with public universities (Huda"
1104,"While there is an extensive literature on de-escalation in a variety of disciplines (in policing and psychiatric nursing in particular), much of it provides theoretically motivated normative procedures, rather than a naturalistic examination of real cases of deescalation. Two exceptions stand out. The first is the literature on negotiation in hostage situations and other crises, and its emphasis on avoiding selection on the dependent variable. Much of this literature has focused on protest or crowd"
1105,"Are movement parties successful transmitters of social movements’ policy demands into institutions and legislature of a country? In other words, do they succeed in representing their associated social movements at the institutional level? Movement parties, as originally defined by Kitschelt (2006: 280), are parties formed by political activists originating from social movements and trying to apply social movements' modes of organisation and strategic practice to the arena of party competition. They are thus actors of a hybrid nature: with one foot in the party system and the other one in the social movement world. Due to this hybrid nature, the agenda of movement parties is often suspected to directly reflect the political demands of the movements from which the movement party developed or with which it is closely"

In adult populations aged 65 and older (the subject of the present research), infection with RSV is estimated to result in as many as 160,000 hospitalizations and 10,000 deaths in a typical year (Havers et al., 2023).Adult RSV vaccines were approved and made available for public use for adults aged 60 or older in Fall 2023. While these vaccines substantially reduce the likelihood that older adults will experience severe complications"
1107,"In this article, we discuss two ongoing projects at the Future Narratives Lab, namely Audible Complexity and Art in the Post-Anthropocene. We have developed an “avalanche machine” called The Rice-Pile Model, which generates avalanches using piles of small particles, such as rice grains, seeds, or other types of particles. The installation utilizes the granular synthesis method to produce continuous and natural sounds as the particles topple along the slope. This article describes two artworks produced as part of this project. The first, Nirvana (2019), is a waterfall installation created entirely from waste materials.

Ireland has ratified a total of 73 ILO conventions, including the Domestic Workers Convention and other fundamental conventions such as the Forced Labor Convention, Minimum Age Convention, and Occupational Safety and Health Convention. Its female labor force participation rate was 58% in 2021, compared to 0.39% in 1991. Ireland ranked 23rd on the Gender 4 Inequality Index in 2019, at 0.093, where 0 is complete equality; this is a big improvement from 25 years ago when it was 0.203."
1109,"The relationship between trade liberalization and growth varies with economic structure. By opening up to trade, countries with comparative advantage in high-tech sectors increase their specialization in those sectors and end up growing faster. Conversely, those with comparative disadvantage in manufacturing are driven by trade opening to reduce their specialization and grow more slowly. In this paper, I provide novel empirical evidence consistent with this view. Using a panel of 161 countries from 1960 to 2019 and a local projections difference-in-differences (LP-DiD) approach, I show that the dynamic medium-term relation between tariff reductions and growth starkly varies with comparative advantages in manufacturing, which I refer to as economic structure, among countries with larger tariff reductions grew faster relative to"

1111,"The political space in general, and political ideologies of the mass public, are often characterized by an economic and a socio-cultural dimension in Europe (Kitschelt, 1994; Kriesi et al., 2008). The relevance of the economic dimension has declined in recent decades, while gender issues have gained in importance since the 1960s. Scholars assume that various issues comprising this dimension are highly correlated as they are driven by the same mechanisms of attitude formation i.e., education and economic security. We lack empirical evidence showing whether the different issues attributed to this dimension indeed align in a unidimensional way. Filling these gaps will inform our understanding of how the European cultural space is structured, which mechanisms explain individual-level variation"
1112,"The analysis of discourse is an essential part of social science research, as it helps to understand a crucial part of the social fabric, which shapes and is shaped by humans as social actors. Many areas of discourse analysis are concerned with the normative positions, or stances, that social actors take in societal discourse. In doing so, social scientists have often classified stances of actors in textual artifacts, such as newspaper articles, manifestos, blog posts, and slogans painted onto walls. The classification of stances is especially difficult in the context of sarcasm, word ambiguity, implicitness, and the interpretation of sentences lacking substantial contextual cues. The main-streaming of computational approaches to analyzing texts via automated text analysis, enabled by natural language processing,"
1113,"Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a highly communicative teaching method widely employed to develop English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ oral proficiency. This study aimed to examine the changes in complexity, accuracy, and fluency among EFL learners of different proficiency levels in a PBL context and to identify the linguistic features in their oral performance. Two research questions are addressed in this study: 1. What are the changes"
1114,"Technology integration has been regarded as an important instructional instrument in language classes because of the extensive use and convenient access that technology offers in improving the quality of teaching and learning. Technology has been defined as a key to facilitating the learning process because technology provides unlimited resources for language learning. However, there are also studies revealing that the integration of technology has posed some challenges despite the benefits and positive feedback obtained from previous studies (Bakar &amp; Lynn, 2019). The challenges include inadequate infrastructure, facilities, low bandwidth and internet connectivity, lack of teachers’ skill, competence and training in adapting technology in classrooms, and preparation time for materials and lessons. In an attempt to overcome the challenges, English teachers have adapted and customised reading lessons"
1115,"Attitudinal polarization in Europe has received relatively little attention, even though polarization is often discussed as a potential risk for social cohesion in light of seemingly polarized debates on immigration, cultural diversity, EU integration, gender and sexual identities, and environmental protection. Attitudinal polarization captures how the attitudes of the general population toward one or many political issues are divided. The concept is most commonly studied in three forms: disagreement, issue alignment, and sorting. Disagreement indicates whether the population is grouped into two opposing camps based on individual attitudes toward a particular political issue. Issue alignment provides an insight into the degree of ideological cross-cuttingness by describing whether individuals’ positions on one political issue are predictive of positions on other issues"
1116,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 6.9 million hospitalizations and over 1.1 million deaths in the United States. The pandemic could have been far worse. The most recent federal data available (from May 2023), finds that only 69.5% of Americans completed their primary CO VID-19 vaccine series, with only 17% receiving an additional booster dose, due in large part to pervasive vaccine hesitancy among some segments of the US population (CDC 2024). Research suggests that this undervaccination has resulted"
1117,"Technology, human society, and communication networks have always been intertwined-from the earliest footpath networks that enabled trade between small groups of people to today's globalized economy connected by Internet-enabled smartphones. However, the tremendous growth in the scale and capabilities for information exchange has yielded something new that is not yet fully understood. With the growth of information technologies, these networks became enmeshed into the fabric of our social and cultural organizations. Most recently, AI algorithms, including large language models (LLMs), have become rapidly adopted across many industries and threaten further disruption of the social fabric through their influence on information flow (Brinkmann et al 2023). We offer the beginnings of a unifying, interdisciplinary framework to help"
1118,"The rapid growth of immigrant populations has driven the development of multicultural education in Finland. In the past two decades, critical multicultural education has gradually become the core discourse system for Finnish scholars to understand multicultural education. To better address the challenges posed by the rapidly diversifying population, Finland underwent basic education reforms in 2014, aiming to enhance educational quality and promote educational equity. This reform led to the introduction of the National Core Curriculum for Early Childhood Education and Care in 2016 (Jokikokko, 2016). The first early childhood curriculum standards in 2003, what specific changes occurred in the early childhood standards? How did multicultural education discourses shift in Finland’s academic discourse on multicultural education manifest in educational policy documents? This study"
1119,"Francis Lieber was a great advocate of the jury system and a great lover of juries. In his book, On Civil Liberty, he praised juries as being the best school of the citizen, both for teaching him his rights and how to protect them, and for practically teaching him the necessity of law and government. However, Lieber’s view on juries was wrong. He would write, '[I]t is my firm conviction, after long observation and study, that the unanimity principle [of juries] ought to be given up . . ."
1120,"This study examines if the inside debt risk is cumulative over maturity: the risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero. I expect that this longitudinal risk (LR), captured as debt micro-risk premium over maturity as Nie (2024a), reflects a manager's skin in the game. I obtain LR for option grants and stockholdings over the (in)visible time lengths of untradability as in Nie. Using yearly data on US acquirers from 2003 to 2021, I investigate if the LR metric raises the effect of age (a negative proxy of maturity) on a manager’s conservatism if the risk moves towards zero when maturity"
1121,"The present study explores the relationship between L2 motivation and motivational learning behaviors among college students enrolled in an English for medicine course at a university in Zhejiang, China. The study also investigates the influence of college entrance English scores as a potential predictor of these behaviors. The significance of this study lies in two aspects: it contributes to the theoretical understanding of L2MSS by exploring its components within the English for Medicine classroom in China, extending the application of the L2 Motivational Self System to a specific educational and cultural setting. Pedagogically, this study offers guidelines for the teachers to make the best use of the specific motivational factors related to learners’ performance to arouse, enhance, and maintain students’"
1122,"In the context of climate activism, it is increasingly common to find in liberal democracies instances of repression, broadly defined as the violation of civil liberties and human rights by state actors with the intent of deterring dissent and political participation. It is therefore critical for us to understand how climate activists and movements sustain their existence over time in response to continued state repression. What is their understanding of the available tools? How do they use them to overcome potential demobilization and other chilling effects following repression? Using interviews with Finnish climate activists from Elokapina, the Finnish branch of Extinction Rebellion, we examine how social media platforms shape social movements’ responses to repression, focusing primarily on how these platforms provide low cost mobilization through information casc"
1123,"Debt has always been part of American life. As the name implies, these were jails used to punish the financially misfortunate. At the time of the American Revolution, only two states offered any constitutional protections to debtors. Today, 8 forty-one states have constitutional provisions explicitly banning imprisonment for debt in whole or in part. This Article seeks to connect those dots, tracing the issue of imprisonment for debts through the constitutions of the states."
1124,"Homeworking (i.e., telecommuting) is generally perceived to allow workers to better balance work and private demands by providing more time for leisure and family. This is done through the reduction of commuting costs, through enhancing the flexibility and permeability of boundaries between work and family (Clark 2000; Halford 2006), and through the increase of work autonomy (Allen, Golden, and Shockley 2015). There is some evidence of homeworking reducing workfamily conflict for parents (Kelly, Moen, and Tranby 2011). However, other studies show that homeworking can increase work-family conflict, particularly for women (Hjálmsdóttir 2021; Yucel and Chung 2023). This is because"
1125,"This study explores the patterns and predictors of community engagement and group membership in 50 countries across seven geographical regions in the World Values Survey (WVS). We examined associations between community membership, educational and employment levels, as well as country-level socioeconomic factors: wealth per capita, income inequality, educational quality, and employment rate. We used data from the WVS Wave 7 (2017) and Wave 8 (2018) surveys conducted in over 90 countries. We found that community membership rates are higher in countries with higher levels of wealth, education and employment, and lower levels of inequality. We also found that membership rates were also high in less advantaged social groups, and less wealthy countries. This suggests that there is a social gradient"
1126,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had far reaching consequences for individuals, including an impact on their well-being. However, the literature in this domain has mostly focused on individual-level explanations and suffers from a lack of causal identification. We argue that analyzing changes in subjective wellbeing (operationalized as overall life satisfaction), is important because, based on sociological theory, a satisfied life constitutes the overall outcome all individuals strive for (Lindenberg 1996)."
1127,"Digital technologies have significantly transformed the publishing industry and the process and practice of measurement of academic achievements. In response to these changes, academics, science librarians, and other stakeholders have extensively discussed the abrupt appearance of predatory publishers and the legacy of “vanity” presses. New actors have stepped into book publishing, such as researchers launching new presses, digital projects, and major corporations 1 (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, and Google) that have started playing a role in academic publishing (Palmer, 2010). In the changing book publishing landscape, reputational capital still matters for scholars and established publishers alike. For scholars , books produced by elite publishers lead to higher chances of promotions and awards, even though"
1128,"In the Anthropocene, the purpose ( why ) of fostering students’ action competence in sustainable development (ACiSD) is central to all quality education. It is this why that shapes 1) the what , 2) the how , and 3) the where and with whom of QUEST (Sass et al., under review). In an effort to deepen the discussion on how QUEST may be operationalized, the current study’s ambition is to explore how the different components can be measured and what light the empirical results of quantitative analyses shed on a further theorizing. In what follows, we focus on what this means for the sustainability teaching-learning process. We build on to to theoretic work by Sass et al. ("
1129,"Although online distance learning opportunities have developed over the past few years, their widespread adoption in all areas of education worldwide has increased significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The abrupt and rapid shift from face-to-face to online learning environments, called emergency remote teaching (ERT), posed significant challenges for educators across various disciplines. In this period of global and local disruption of traditional teaching routines, educators’ satisfaction with navigating this unfamiliar environment is likely to profoundly impact the teaching process and the well-being of both instructors and students. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the relationship between language teachers’ TPACK and satisfaction with teaching online. Adequate TPACK may enable"
1130,"International development cooperation is understood as one of the essential strategies for achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) (Helgason 2016; OECD 2023; United Nations 2019). As such, international development cooperation fundamentally depends on the way that particular projects are envisioned, planned, designed and implemented. Crucially, all these aspects are shaped by their underpinning knowledge systems. Such knowledge systems comprise the way relevant actors understand the world in which international development projects are nested, and, consequently, which types of knowledge and resulting interventions in social-ecological dynamics they prioritize and embark on. To this end, it is vital to map and better understand where such knowledge originates from, how it is created, distributed, and utilized. To"
1131,"Most disability representations are introduced through an othering stare that frames disability and disabled people within stigmatizing harmful stereotypes. Drawing on critical disability studies and visual analysis scholarship, this paper will highlight how staring back is used as a tool for resistance and activism in Awesomely Emma , a picturebook by Amy Webb (2020) and illustrated by Merrilee Liddiard. The book’s disabled protagonist, Emma, is empowered to stare back at her starer (both characters in the book and readers themselves) to resist silencing, marginalization, and stereotyping. She also inverses the staring encounter to demand her right to exist in public spaces and claim her disability identity. The researcher chooses this picturebook because it, as will"
1132,"The study of social inequality is a core concern of the discipline of sociology. The first difficulty is how one should define the scope of SVE. Is SVE a coherent research field that is increasingly institutionalized through key journals and publications? Or is the concern with (e)valuation a more general research perspective that cuts across different fields and literatures? A second difficulty is defining social inequality. Following wellestablished accounts (cf. Warwick-Booth 2018), we define social inequality as the unequal access to resources and desirable social positions, usually based upon membership in social groups, and resulting in systematic (dis-)advantages in the life chances"
1133,"Pakistan has ratified 36 ILO conventions, of which 31 are in force, but these do not include C183, C156, C189, or C143 - the key conventions related to carework. A significant proportion of Pakistan's population is employed in the informal sector, and nearly a quarter live below the poverty line. As a result of its lack of comprehensive national legislation for unpaid family caregivers or paid domestic workers, Pakistan scores poorly on the GCPI, with a score of 2.73 (out of 10) – thus placing it in the lower end of the ‘Emerging’ Index Band of the"
1134,"The Abraham Accords, signed on September 15th, 2020, is the first peace treaty between Israel and United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The treaty is signed in the context of the Israeli-United Arab Emirates peace treaty and the global COVID-19 pandemic. The paper combines the theories of Classical Realism, Neo-realism, and Constructivism to explore the factor(s) contributing to the signing of the Accords. The research concludes that the successful signature of Abraham Accord is attributed to the interactions between multiple factors and behaviors, including the US’s intervention in the Middle East, the Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and the involvement of relevant leaders of Middle Eastern countries, especially important figures under the dictatorship"
1135,"In February 2023, UNESCO launched the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report to look at the requirements of good leadership in education, and how they may vary between countries and over time in seeking to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we use ‘school leadership’ in this broad sense to discuss its role in achieving sustainable life for humans and other species on Earth. The term ‘Anthropocene’ was coined by Crutzen and Stoermer in a newsletter for the Geological Society in 2000 to describe a new epoch, superseding the Holocene, in which the human species has had dramatic impact on the planet; we use it here for historical positioning and"
1136,"Statistical analyses in the health and social sciences are becoming more complex. Increases in the size and variety of data available and reductions in computational costs have led to the development of new algorithms and statistical methods as well as a general expansion of possibilities in data analysis. It is increasingly common to see empirical papers including the results of tens, if not thousands, of models, be it to repeat a regression model across multiple datasets (Bann et al. 2022), to use an “exposure-wide” (Ioannidis 2016) or “outcome-wide"
1137,"Journalism is considered to be a field reflecting power relationships. Through the lens of Bourdieu’s (1986) field theory, journalism is considered as a field that reflects the power relations between several actors: habitus, doxa , and capital. Habitus is a response structure that allows journalists to respond to the tasks before them. Doxa refers to the knowledge of the game in which actors are often socialized. Actors share the essential belief that the game itself is worth playing (Benson &amp; Neveu, 2006). In journalism this has in the past been discussed in relation to the rootedness of a journalist in news values. Capital refers to scarce resources that draw actors to act within"
1138,"In the Sierra Leone civil war, rebels often capture territory from the government, leading to violence against civilians in the transition period between territorial capture and de facto rebel rule. What does territorial takeover mean for civilians living under newly established rebel control? We examine this research question by statistically analyzing the dynamics of violence towards civilians in territory that has recently been captured by rebel groups. We argue that rebels use violence against non-combatants as a tool to establish ruling institutions when they initially lack the resources and knowledge to reign nonviolently. We do this for multiple spatiotemporal windows (Schutte &amp; Donnay"
1139,"Kazakhstan attained an overall GCPI score of 5.13 out of 10, placing it at the bottom of the “Maturing” band of the Index. It provides good protections during pregnancy and maternity leave, and offers flexible work arrangements to employees with care responsibilities, but needs to improve in other areas, such as paternity leave and dependent care leave. Overall, Kazakhstan demonstrated a low level of support for working fathers. Kazakhstan is considered an emerging market and developing economy."
1140,"In the early 2020s, the pandemic world of the early 2030s, pandemic prediction and modeling became a global issue. Epidemiological models became the increasing basis of political decision-making on lock-downs, mask-wearing, and pandemic handling. In a sense, during this period it seems that the world became flattened to the mathematical and algorithmic through the reliance on epidemiological modeling. In such a world, materialities, cultures, habits, movements, and people became reduced to general models detailing infectiousness and reproduction values of a disease. The world seemed to have become a completely flat domain, where nothing but the model and its calculations mattered. The computer model, the algorithm-the world without wrinkles or"
1141,"Consulting services tailored to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have proven essential for fostering innovation and competitiveness, integrating support from governmental, academic, and business sectors. This collaborative approach grants SMEs access to specialized knowledge, fosters an innovation-oriented mindset, and enables the use of advanced technological tools. Government policies, accelerator programs, and consulting services collectively promote innovation by facilitating financing access, offering business training, and providing vital resources for managing innovation processes. The primary aim of these initiatives is to enhance business management while building SMEs’ capacity to innovate. This study focuses on how the self-assessment of eight critical areas of innovation management can address common challenges SMEs face, such as limited growth and low"
1142,"In the past decades, European welfare states failed to make progress in reducing poverty. Despite economic and employment growth and high levels of social spending, poverty either rose or remained stable in the vast majority of European countries (Cantillon, 2011; Jenkins, 2020; Michálek &amp; Výbošťok, 2019). While during the COVID-19 pandemic, most European countries expanded welfare programs and social insurance schemes to cushion its socioeconomic effects, poverty rates remained stable throughout. While commitments to further reduce poverty at the EU level have been expressed and EU headline targets for 2030 have been set, the strategies to achieve these targets strongly focus on increasing employment rates whilst providing adequate social protection through modernised"
1143,"In the Soviet Union, goods are allocated not through markets but through an annual plan drawn up using material balances that endeavor to ensure that the output of each product has the inputs required in its production. The balance is constructed using norms or coefficients. A tonne of steel requires a certain quantity of inputs such as iron ore, coal, oxygen and alloys. A pair of size 10 shoes requires leather, thread and metal eyelets. At the same time a balance is drawn up for labor requirements. On the supply side you have imports, beginning-year stocks and current production available for use in the present period."
1144,"We consider two states that decide whether to create an IO or make policy ad hoc . Both states care about how their policy adapts to their domestic economy and how coordinated it is with the other state’s policy. We compare and contrast two institutions that symbolize the absence and presence of an IO. In the first, states act without a formalized structure and make their own decisions; in the second, an IO makes decisions on the states’ behalf. Our goal is to analyze the strategic implications of the creation of IOs and their impact on states' policies and information transmission. First, Nature draws two random variables, each one being private information for each state, i.e., each state's type. These"
1145,"The complexity of the concept of the public continues to evade the discipline of public administration (PA). Scholars often discuss the people, the citizens, the customer, the client, the community, or the stakeholders and then move on without deeper analysis (Frederickson, 1991, 2021). Scholars of public opinion argued for the necessity of technocratic control in democracies (Lippman, 1922). Public interest (Goodin, 1996) and public good (Dahl, 1989) scholars emphasized the common good and the general welfare. Public choice scholars reframed the public in economic terms (Ostrom &amp; Ostrom, 1971)"
1146,"The United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union in 2016 was a significant political event, which coincided with the rise of right-wing populist movements in the European political landscape. The prevailing theory behind the Brexit vote suggests that economic insecurity among voters was a primary factor, with those feeling left behind due to structural shifts in the labor market more likely to support the Leave campaign. This theory suggests that deprived citizens, both individually and regionally, were more inclined to vote Leave. However, little research has been conducted on the intersection of individual and regional deprivation. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by examining the association between individual deprivation and voting preferences in the Brexit referendum. Our empirical analysis is based on large,"
1147,"Academic faculty play a central role within the knowledge economy, shaping societal development and informing policy decisions. A lack of socioeconomic diversity among academic faculty can stifle innovation and limit how effectively challenges are addressed. This study aims to broaden the limited research by leveraging population-wide administrative microdata on university employees and the broader public to explore the social origins of academic faculty. Our focus is on Norway, an egalitarian welfare state with a publicly funded higher education system, competitive wages for PhD researcher positions, and comparatively high rates of intergenerational mobility. First, socioeconomic inequality in the likelihood of becoming a faculty member is the culmination of a long process that begins with achievements in early education (Chmielewski 2019; Skopek and Pass"
1148,"In December 2022, around 1,000 business representatives attended the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), marking the “first time the private sector had turned out in force for a biodiversity COP” (Hillsdon, 2022). Corporate influence at Convention for Biological Diversity (CBD) meetings is not new (Dempsey, 2016), but private sector attendance at COP15 is indicative of current trends in biodiversity conservation: namely, the framing of biodiversity loss as a material financial risk to global capital (WEF, 2020), and the role of “leveraging private finance” in achieving the vision of the Kunming-Montreal Global"
1149,"This paper reports on the findings of a study investigating the development of Algerian University learners’ intercultural competence (IC) when engaged in virtual intercultural exchanges (or lack thereof). Such partnerships contain activities designed to help students become more flexible with different others and equip them with abilities needed for effective Intercultural exchanges. Currently, little is known about intercultural teaching/learning in Algerian Higher education and whether telecollaborative partnerships are likely to"
1150,"Developing democracies face three types of impediments to efficient welfarism: structural constraints like inadequate state capacity, resistance from party intermediaries, and weak electoral incentives. In India, state capacity does not constrain the adoption of rule-based direct transfers. The government has access to fine-grained socioeconomic data from decadal censuses to formulate objective rules and identify beneficiaries. It can use biometric authentication to confirm that the actual recipient of a benefit is the intended beneficiary. Nearly 99.9 percent of adults in the country have a biometric identity."
1151,"Today’s dynamic and rapidly changing labor market is influenced by the constant development of new technologies, globalization, the changing nature of the economy, and changing demands on employees. These changes are resulting in a global transformation of civilization. In this context, university graduates are expected to be flexible, dynamic, and able to adapt effectively to new, rapidly changing conditions of the labor market, to the changes in individual jobs, and to the transformations and challenges that society is going through in the 21st century. The above-mentioned technological developments force academia to change how knowledge is transferred in the education process. This also entails changes to the interaction between teacher and student. It should not be forgotten that every educational context is still strongly influenced by"
1152,"Concealment and its related forms, including lying, secrecy, and selective disclosure, are fundamental features of all groups, organizations, and societies. There is rarely a moment in our daily lives when we are not actively withholding information from others. We lie to employers about our skills and abilities. We misrepresent the quality of used cars to potential buyers. We hide our political beliefs from others to avoid conflict. We conceal our sexual preferences from those who would use such information against us. And we lie to friends about our negative evaluations of their personalities to spare their feelings."
1153,"Human behavioral ecology (HBE) emerged as a coherent area of intellectual inquiry in the social sciences in the mid-1970s and early 1980s primarily in the United States of America. Its goal is to use principles of Darwinian natural selec6on to understand how people modify behaviors in response to varia6on in socio-ecological environments. In doing so, HBE provides a powerful, testable (hence rejectable) scien6fic framework that can help to explain why people behave similarly versus dissimilarly across contexts. In this review, we describe the discipline of HBE, focusing on its applica6ons in China, past, present, and future. We view its expansion into China"
1154,"Miscarriages are spontaneous pregnancy losses before 20 to 28 weeks of gestation with the definition varying depending on the context. They are common: around 13 to 19% of medically recognized pregnancies and between 20 to 30% of all pregnancies result in a miscarriage (Linnakaari et al., 2019). Approximately 20 to 25% of women 3 experience at least one miscarriage in their reproductive life. To the best of our knowledge, the extent of miscarriage misreporting has rarely been studied outside the US. Therefore, building on Tennekoon (2017), we first ask whether a modelbased approach developed for abortion reporting can also be applied to miscarriages. We apply this approach to the French Fertility, Contraception and Dysfunction Survey"
1155,"English as a medium of instruction (EMI) is the application of the English language to teach academic topics where English is a foreign language in higher education institutions worldwide. The current study aims to identify the main challenges faced by the first-year students during the implementation of EMI through the following research questions: 1. What are the students’ attitudes towards implementing EMI courses at the tertiary level in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, which is the context of the current study, as the majority of the universities are adopting the English as a Medium of Instruction in their major, such as accounting, science, engineering, and mathematics (Chen et al., 2020). 2. The main challenges encountered by the students"
1156,"Gentrification exacerbates the social and economic precarities Black Cincinnatians must navigate while residing within Cincinnati's gentrifying neighborhoods. The current wave of gentrification manifesting across Cincinnati’s inner city and its gentrified neighborhoods has led to the forced displacement of Black and low-income residents who cannot afford to pay more to stay in their homes due to the rising cost of living in the city and across the U.S., as well as the gentrification of neighborhoods on its outskirts. In this study, I conducted a survey of Black residents of Cincinnati‌– the majority of whom are lifelong residents of the city‌�– who have experienced gentrification, I asked them to share their experiences"
1157,"Socio-economic inequalities in common mental disorders (CMDs) such as lifetime prevalence, treatment utilisation, and perceived treatment helpfulness have been documented in various settings. However, whether these inequalities are present globally (in both HICs and LMICs) and what factors explain between-country variation is unclear because of inadequate cross-national data. We therefore examine this question using a recently published global, individual-level survey data. This study uses a nationally representative individual- level survey dataset (Wellcome Global Monitor 2020), in 111 countries (N= 117,088) to test if socio-economic factors (household income quintile, education), psycho-social factors (local stigma perception, trust in health professionals)"
1158,"The role of social media, and digital networks more generally, in civic society is a growing scholarly and public concern (Bennett and Segerberg, 2012; Earl and Kimport, 2011; Liu, 2020). This was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and government lock downs of large parts of society, including the provision of both public and private welfare services, resulted in an urgent and diverse set of needs. In response to these needs and the altered circumstances, we witnessed massive mobilization of voluntary help and support, especially within digital networks, in civil societies across the world. This development poses central questions concerning the ability of social networks to facilitate help, particularly with regard to the volume and"
1159,"Since 2019, worldwide education has changed, and, accordingly, the learning process has shifted. The purpose of distance learning is to provide students with learning opportunities directly at their place of residence, work, or temporary stay. Such studying has a flexible nature, and students usually do not attend regular classes in the form of lectures and seminars. They are provided with the necessary textbooks, manuals, explicit curricula, and tasks of various natures. These requirements can be met by the latest computer-based learning tools, which include electronic manuals, multimedia courses, training programs, etc. (Vlasenko &amp; Shynkarenko, 2013)."
1160,"Museums are the representative of our cultural heritage. It plays a crucial role in preserving the art and craft of culture by careful documenting and preserving the artifacts. Due to such effort of documentation, culture can be recorded and remembered for a regardless time in future. In this way museums converted in such places where an ample number of cultural objects are accessible for the exploration, learning and enjoyment to various kinds of visitors like children, adult, student and travelers. However, the policy of exclusion for various kind visitors is also prevalent in the museum due to vision-centric nature of museum and architecturally designed for people without any difficulties. One such example is the exclusion of visually impaired people from the museum. For example, a inadequately plan pathway and"
1161,"In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework to analyze electoral competition under RCV, and we use it to examine widely held contentions about RCV's benefits relative to a plurality rule. RCV is widely employed in local and state elections, both in general elections and in the primaries of both major US political parties. The first contention we assess is that RCV encourages candidates to pursue a broad electoral appeal instead of focusing on their core supporters. This contention rests on the following logic: under plurality, a candidate only benefits from the support of voters that prefer her to every other candidate. This encourages a candidate to focus on mobilizing the narrow segment of voters"

It is understood that a qualitative description cannot be achieved by any consistent rule , and this idea is considered in the distinction granted in the macroscopic and microscopic frames of this article. The article follows an inferred distinction between different psychological apprehensions: these are the microscopic/microcosm (the subject matter of the object connector), the macroScopic (the works of Jung, Lacan, et cetera), and the phenomenal (measured outputs"
1163,"Social opportunity structure (SOS) refers to the set of individuals available to form social ties under conditions of repeated interaction. These notions are difficult to measure empirically for at least three reasons. First, the concept of SOS requires capturing opportunities for contact, rather than actual social interaction. Individuals may not be aware of such opportunities or may be unable to report on them accurately. Second, there is a possibility that such potential contacts that are hard to identify are the most relevant for the outcome of interest. Third, the fact that interaction opportunities are distributed across multiple contexts (e.g. workplaces, neighborhoods, sport associations) requires adopting a multi-context perspective to fully understand an individual’s social position. An alternative approach for"
1164,"An online survey was completed by Australian parents and carers of school-aged children (hereafter “parents”) in 2021. The initial cleaned sample size was 2,427. Several respondents with conflicting answers on the gender demographic question were also excluded from this analysis, giving a final sample size of 2,418. The methodology and general characteristics of respondents are described elsewhere (Hendriks et al. 2023)."
1165,"Despite the growth of computational text analysis in the social sciences, our knowledge of the social influences on textual production in large scale processes is limited. We analyze a corpus of 254,814 admissions essays and associated metadata submitted by 83,536 applicants to the University of California system over two admissions cycles (2015-2016 and 2016-2017). These essays represent the entire universe of in-state applicants who identified as Latinx/Hispanic, enabling important insights into intragroup variation that is not always possible 1 . Specific metadata include gender identification, reported household income, whether they were the first in their family to attend college or not, and the ZIP code of the applicant’s high school; additional details are described in the Materials and Methods"
1166,"Pragmatic competence, the ability to use language appropriately in social contexts, encompasses understanding not just literal meanings but also implied intentions and social nuances conveyed through language. Teaching this competence poses challenges for language instructors, requiring authentic materials and opportunities for honest communication. One of the ways how to develop this competence and awareness of the use of hedging language in spoken and written performance is to incorporate working with corpus texts into language teaching. As specialists in pragmalinguistics and corpus linguistics, we chose to delve into this linguistic phenomenon through corpus analysis of the British National Corpus, focusing on spoken discourse, where pragmatic competence is most evident. Hedges function as a shield for the speaker or text writer and protect them from potential regrets by"
1167,"As the world is rapidly shifting towards globalization, Arab nationals, and especially Saudis got an increased exposure to the Western countries and culture in pursuit of better educational opportunities and lifestyle shift. Due to the rapid development in major Gulf countries like UAE and Saudi Arabia, new business ventures and opportunities have accelerated the need and acceptance of English language as even though Arabic is the official language of these countries, many international companies work through English language and consider it as a prerequisite to professional success. In the present time, Saudi students love to dress like Western celebrities, listen to music by foreign artists over Arab artists, and surprisingly find themselves aloof from their own Arab culture while more attached and connected with that of the West. With that, the social media and"
1168,"This research paper focuses on English pronunciation errors made by Libyan students learning English as a foreign language, with a specific emphasis on their pronunciation errors. The research encompasses various educational levels, including high school and university students. The study does not cover all aspects of English language acquisition, such as grammar, vocabulary, or listening comprehension. It does not delve into other factors such as motivation, language learning strategies, or individual learner differences. While the investigation includes the influence of the Arabic language on pronunciation errors, it does not explore other factors, including motivation,"
1169,"Global supply chains have evolved into highly complex networks involving numerous stakeholders, cross-border transactions, and regulatory frameworks, making them increasingly vulnerable to illicit trade activities such as fraud, counterfeiting, and smuggling. Traditional supply chain management has long relied on paper-based documentation and fragmented communication systems, leading to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and security gaps. To address these challenges, digital technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been explored to enhance security, efficiency, and resilience in supply chain operations. One of the most ambitious attempts at applying blockchain technology in global logistics was TradeLens, a platform co-developed by Maersk and IBM to enhance supply chain transparency"
1170,"In the American popular consciousness, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union from 1922 to the Cold War's end) has often served as the “anti-nation” while America was Anglo Protestant, capitalist, moral, and free. Historically, leaders of Christian Right were among the most suspicious toward Russia because they were the most adamantly ethnonationalist and anti-Communist, associating communism with ethno-racial outsiders and Civil Rights agitators, leftism, and atheism (e.g., Falwell 1980). Unsurprisingly, data from 1974 to 1994 shows both political and religious conservatives held the most antipathy toward Russia. However, following Vladimir Putin’s election as Russian President in 2012 and Russia�"
1171,"This article presents a proposal for a mechanical theory of social change, based on Newtonian mechanics. It is based on the idea that the tools developed to describe physical systems can be used to describe certain social systems under appropriate conditions. Specifically, we study the motion of a particle subject to free motion, a force described by Hooke's law, and a stochastic interaction, governed by the Smoluchowski equation, and we describe partisan preferences in the United States as outlined by presidential elections. In Section 2, we introduce and develop fundamental concepts for the mechanical theory, and in Section 3 we use those fundaments to describe some initial models. We then present the results of our study, which show similarities between evolution of social"
1172,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most widely discussed topics in news reports and research worldwide. This article examines the complex interrelationship between Data Centers, Critical Minerals, Energy, and Geopolitics – the foundational elements that sustain AI – and the multiple trade-offs associated with its operation, many of which remain largely unknown to the general public. The article first examines the physical infrastructure that supports AI, emphasizing the significant increase in the number and capacity of data centers. These facilities house millions of essential components needed to meet growing demands for computational power and data storage, underscoring their reliance on critical minerals and metals. The third section addresses the high energy intensity of AI, which significantly surpasses that of traditional digital applications"
1173,"The #DisruptJMM hashtag was created in response to the 2020 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM), a joint convening of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in January of 2020. The hashtag peaked in popularity at the subsequent JMM in January 2020, as many mathematicians heeded Dr. Piper H’s call to include conversations on equity and inclusion in their otherwise mathematical talks. Mathematicians in particular engaged in spirited public debate (through op-eds in the AMS Notices) on the appropriateness of using diversity statements in the hiring process, and in particular the STEM professional society meeting experience was emerging across disciplines. The #Dis"

1175,"This paper traces the technological devaluation of women throughout Western history, in fiction as well as in real events, with a specific focus on artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that this history shows a pattern in which the dehumanization of women as/and/or feminised subjects on the one hand, and the humanization of AI on the other hand, have been mutually constitutive. In other words, this pattern traces not merely replacement, but displacement of women by technology, through which women have been - and continue to be - harmed in various ways. This paper presents a lens that can be used to make this pattern, and these forms of harm, clearly visible. We dub this tool the Pygmalion lens after"
1176,"The 2021 UNESCO released the Recommendation on Open Science was signed by 193 countries and underscored the global commitment to OS (UNESCO 2022). The declaration extended the existing definitions of Open Science to foreground the values of inclusivity and equity and the principle of sustainability. The recommendation went on to provide a definition of equity and fairness as: “enabling fair and reciprocal sharing of scientific inputs and outputs and equal access to scientific knowledge to both producers and consumers of knowledge regardless of location, nationality, race, age, gender"
1177,"With the acknowledgement of the Anthropocene as a new geological era, it becomes apparent that human decisions on how (to limit) exploitation of life-sustaining resources largely impacts the future of planet Earth. The magnitude of the consequences of human behavior as a formidable force of nature implies a great responsibility of current and future generations when making decisions regarding resource management. This calls for a reorientation of what it is to be human, as human beings are becoming aware of their responsibility regarding the Earth’s future and the need to implement sustainable lifestyles. Against this background, quality education has become a prominent point of attention on the agendas of international policy makers and the research community across the globe. But which qualities should education encompass towards such"

The QMER learning community has focused on improving access to, and attainment of: (1) academic professional skills and competencies; and (2) foundational STEM skills and advanced research methods. Through a combination of collaborative workshops, research teams, and extracurricular support groups, the QMER"
1179,"Communication technology is very important for humans to make it easier to communicate, interact, socialize and various other activities. Communication technology is hardware that plays a role in organizational structures and has social value, which can enable each individual to collect, process and share information with other people. The main focus of communications technology is how data can be sent, distributed, and received at its destination. Along with advances in science over time, technology has also experienced rapid development. This development really helps simplify human activities. The use of social media is also very significant, with 160 million users in Indonesia. Even though social media can have a positive impact and benefits in the development of science and technology, such as making communication easier, finding and accessing"
1180,"The variability in the ages at which individuals die (also known as “lifespan inequality”) is unarguably “the most important of all inequalities” because all other inequalities one might care about are conditional on being alive (van Raalte et al 2018, page 1002). During the last decades, investigations around this topic have expanded in several directions, documenting the levels and trends in lifespan inequality both across and within countries. A fundamental issue that remains poorly understood in this literature has to do with the sources of lifespan inequality. Which factors are the most important drivers of such inequality and its changes over time"
1181,"As societies become larger and more populous, some set of core features are said to be necessary for supporting cooperation and social cohesion within increasingly large, complex, and diverse societies. These include accessible political institutions, constitutional law, limitations on the exercise of power, and a suite of ideological and philosophical traits promoting moralizing, universalizing, egalitarian, and prosocial ideals. These developments were also found to be driven by competition between societies, as those able to develop such features generally outcompeted others in inter-state conflict, leading to their spread in different areas and cultural contexts. The relationship between these different supposedly critical traits that support social cooperation and cohesion, and the abandonment of alternate social forms, however, has not been subjected to large"
1182,"There are currently 108 million forcibly displaced people globally, a number that has more than doubled in the last decade (UNHCR 2022). While the majority remains internally displaced, 35.5 million had to leave their home country, embarking into an often perilous and difficult future. And although many of these forcefully displaced people hope to establish themselves in their new host countries, many others ultimately wish to return home (Ghosn et al. 2021; Zakirova and Buzurukov 2021), since forced displacement is associated with lower mental and physical health and significant economic hardship. The desirability (and feasibility) of such a return is complicated further by declining acceptance of forcefully displaced peoples and refugees in receiving countries. As such,"
1183,"Suicide contagion is the idea that observing a behavior in others makes it more likely that a person will exhibit similar behavior in themselves. In particular, when I view somebody else as similar to me, I am more inclined to adopt their behaviors as my own. The empirical literature on suicide contagion, while impressive, leaves some questions unanswered. Studies largely focus on the effects of celebrity suicides, which limits our understanding of contagion in two ways. First, celebrities are high-status, well-known, and often widely beloved. Second, a lower-status person's suicide might produce similar imitative effects. The present study seeks to provide more robust evidence that imitation persists when behavioral models are fictional or low-status"
1184,"In this commentary, we present the results of an investigation of 28 experimental studies published in Tourism Management, the Journal of Travel Research or Annals of Tourism Research in 2022 that included statements, which were not accurately reflecting the permissible conclusions given the research design. We could have chosen any of 28 articles published in 2022 or in-press to be published in upcoming issues of Tourism Management. We first screened papers at abstract level and removed irrelevant studies. The remaining articles were analysed at full-text level for compliance with our selection criteria. We did not identify any natural field studies that were not retrospective. We also did not find any studies that included only proxy measures (e.g., eye tracking or skin conductance) or emotion-based"
1185,"Video games have shown potential in enhancing cognitive and language skills. Video games provide an interactive and engaging platform catering to various learning styles, making them an attractive alternative to traditional learning methods. The immersive environments and contextualized language used in video games can offer learners practical applications of new vocabulary in realtime scenarios. As digital natives, today’s students are increasingly comfortable with technology, and leveraging video games for education can bridge the gap between entertainment and learning, as shown in a systematic review on the use of video games"
1186,"Prosecutors are locally elected officials with significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system. In recent decades, prosecutors in the United States have wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration and its racial disparities. More recently, a growing number of 'progressive' prosecutors have campaigned on promises to mitigate these harms by using their discretion to reduce charges, the use of cash bail and pretrial detention, and racial disparities (Davis 2019). Progressive prosecutors have also generally pledged to meet growing calls for accountability of police violence, a key demand of the Movement for Black Lives (BLM; ibid). As progressive prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers, particularly since 2016, so too has resistance against them. To date,"

Yet we know little about the academic outcomes of a unique and growing group: foreign-born children of return migrants. Azose and Raftery (2019) estimate that about one in four migration events are a return to a person's country of birth, amounting to millions of return"
1188,"In St Thomas Aquinas’ Summa Theologica (Aquinas, 1265-73), the ‘Angelic Doctor’ asks if God’s existence can be proved, and answers in the affirmative, the second of his “Five Ways” (Quinqae Viae) being: “The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient causes of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not"
1189,"In this article, I attempt to explain the one-sidedness in how the provision of national health care in the UK is discussed and how the challenge of its funding is framed. In part, and in the developed world in large part, an individual’s health outcomes are affected by lifestyle and other behavioural choices, e.g. dietary energy overconsumption, excessive alcohol intake, binge drinking, inactivity, recreational drug use, etc., yet, these are treated with deference (in the case of illegal activities, often even by the police)"
1190,"On 14 October 2023, Australian voters participated in the Indigenous Voice to Parliament Referendum (hereafter the Voice referendum or the Voice). Australians were required to vote in a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment aimed at establishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. This body, as envisioned, would serve the purpose of advising both the Parliament and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters pertaining to laws and policies that affect Indigenous Australians. The referendum results did not meet that threshold, with 60.1% of Australians voting No, while 39.9% supported the referendum, leading to the rejection of the Voice"
1191,"The PAD class is a localized teaching model proposed based on the practical teaching context in China. There is relatively little research on this topic in foreign countries. Most of the existing foreign literature is published by Chinese scholars in foreign conferences and journals. By searching Springer with keywords such as PAD Class or PAD teaching model , it was discovered that foreign research on PAD"
1192,"In social science research, integrity and reliability are critical to the quality of research instruments. Given the increasingly complex research methodologies nowadays, rigorous instrument validation is called for more than ever. In this regard, the Research Instrument Validation Framework (RIVF) has provided a comprehensive approach toward such a challenge by integrating face, content, and construct validity assessments, but applying such a framework presents significant challenges explicitly novice researchers (Kyriazos et al., 2018).Recent developments in artificial intelligence and web-based technologies hold the potential to address these challenges. Moreover, the development of this ecosystem is based on valid theoretical frameworks-that of the unified validity theory by Messick in 1995, and the argument-based approach by Kane in 2013."
1193,"Mental health is an absent state of mental disorders. However, a new definition has been proposed, which not only involves the absence of a disease but also involves aspects present in the individual, such as optimism, life satisfaction, and resilience. The previous concept is Positive Mental Health (PMH), defined as the general presence of emotional, psychological, and social well-being. In this alternate definition, the individual can identify strengths they have to face their daily activities. Therefore, PMH is now considered a protective factor for mental health disorders and even a predictor in their recovery (Huang et al., 2021). According to this, it is possible to understand how PMH elements can be present simultaneously as a mental health disorder"
1194,"This paper presents an original research methodology for comparatively analysing waste management service efficiency in urban areas and provides adequate evidence using alternative measures of costs according to the phase of the waste management chain, the scale, and ultimately the scope of municipal solid waste management services. Based on the empirical data on municipal waste management costs, on average, the size and the average cost of the service are inversely related. Multiple factors aid in explaining this result, and among others, due to scale and scope, factors such as transition costs increase with the number of players running different services. This paper demonstrated that a single-provider waste management business model is efficient under specific conditions, as in this article."
1195,"The past two decades have brought an onslaught of policies that criminalize immigrants in the United States, making their lives more precarious and threatened by surveillance, detention, deportation, and exploitation. Yet, immigrants are also often held up as contributors to U.S. society and key institutions. This duality reflects the fraught and often contradictory position immigrants hold in the American psyche. As Bosniak (2006) and other political theorists have highlighted, these narratives serve each other. Demarcating the alien helps clarify the boundaries"
1196,"Dylan Thomas is one of the most influential Welsh poets of the 20th-century. He is known for his vivid imagery, complex wordplay, and innovative use of language. However, there remains a gap in understanding his poetry, as different linguistic choices made in his poetry can play an essential role in inferring particular meanings hidden in his poems. This study aims to help literature students understand Thomas’s writings by examining the stylistic features of his selected poem, Before I Knocked. The study uses stylistic analysis and the theory of foregrounding supported by the Leech and Shorts checklist. Within the checklist, the study only focuses on foregrounding aspects, and figures of speech. Due to the word limit,"
1197,"In the past two decades, internet platforms have emerged as key social and technical institutions for communication and interactions. The ways in which they govern user activities has tremendous consequences for how our increasingly digital society is organised. Growing controversies around issues such as hate speech and misinformation point to the role and responsibility of platforms for the regulation of public speech and communication dynamics. Platforms have reacted by gradually abandoning their self-positioning as neutral technical intermediaries and by formulating increasingly extensive sets of rules that govern what kind of content and conduct are allowed or prohibited on their services. While these platforms have offered more and more information about their moderation processes and decisions upon mounting public and policy pressure, it remains remarkably hard to systematically understand and study the changing rules"
1198,"In 2022, the Department for Education in England (DfE) published its first official response to the climate and ecological crises, ‘Sustainability &amp; climate change: A strategy for the education and children’s services systems’. It relates to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address the biodiversity crisis, to protect and connect with the natural world, and to work locally and globally towards more sustainable and equitable futures. It also introduces several initiatives: a virtual National Education Nature Park to enhance biodiversity education across all education settings, a Climate Action Award to recognize those settings which enhance students’ green skills and appreciation of nature (Natural History Museum, 2023) and a GCSE in natural history"
1199,"Criminal Background Checks (CBCs) are requests for information about previous convictions for non-judicial purposes, such as during recruitment processes or when the search of accomodation. The use of CBCs is widely considered as “de facto” punishment since the State is covertly intervening in the exclusion of offenders by facilitating information on prior convictions to members of the community, knowing that a predictable consequence of the disclosure of this information is the discrimination of those people with a criminal record, subsequently diminishing their job and housing opportunities. Previous studies on CBCs coincide in depicting a rise of these checks in Western countries such as the US, the UK, The Netherlands, Sweden and Spain, although not much is known from other parts of"
1200,"Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) has become the reality of modern workplaces where workers from different cultures interact and collaborate regardless of where they are located (Deardorff, 2015). That is, ICC has become an essential employability skill in today’s global markets. With this in mind, the study raises the question of whether Algerian EFL students have sufficient intercultural communicative skills to interact effectively and appropriately in intercultural encounters . Since assessment is part of the development of students’ intercultural competence, as Griffith et al. (2016) and Borghetti (2017) emphasize, this study aims to evaluate the development"
1201,"In Why Cultures Persist: Toward a Cultural Immunology, Jesper Sørensen uses a complex adaptive systems perspective to organize material from cognitive science, sociology, immunology, and anthropology to propose a novel way of conceptualizing cultures and their dynamics. The book's strengths lie in its emphasis on distributed biological metaphors, the CAS framework, the Free Energy Principle, and the notion of ritual as a key constitutive element. However, it falls short by inadequately considering the interlocking effects between metabolism, reproduction, and immunity, failing to provide a theoretically usable definition of ""interaction sphere,"" and insufficiently connecting to relevant complex systems research across various fields. We argue that the ambitious premises of the book are likely"
1202,"Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) has been used in the field of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) as an alternative to traditional methods of teaching phonetics. The present study investigates the effect of using MALL in teaching Phonetics to EFL university students. The study was conducted on 60 university students majoring in Information Technology in Malaysia. Data were collected from the participants using a pre-test before the treatment and a post-test at the end of the assigned period (i.e., 14 weeks). Collected data were statistically analyzed to provide answers to the following research questions: What are the most challenging vowel sounds for EFL learners learning phonetics? The study concluded that MALL is more"
1203,"In the area of EST, there has been a very deep and active scientific and philosophical discussion for decades to identify criteria for assessing the epistemic quality of empirical evidence (for a summary, see Castro-Toledo, 2021a). However, in the criminological field one of the most effusive responses was offered by Sherman et al. (1997) when, in evaluating the use of empirical data in the development of public crime prevention and response strategies, they observed that not all research designs are equally valid, since not all generate empirical evidence of the same quality. More specifically, Sherman and his collaborators established the so-called “Maryland Scale of Scientific Methods”, which offers a ranking of the strength of"
1204,The Risk Interpretation Framework (RIF) is an integrated theory of crime fear. It draws on theories of neighborhood incivility and routine activities to understand how people subjectively define and interpret victimization risk within the broader context of their neighborhood. It also describes how individuals process situational opportunities for victimization in terms of risk and fear by drawing on their perceived vulnerabilities as well as their past experiences with crime. The following sections provide an overview of the framework by defining and describing how each set of concepts operate in conjunction with risk perceptions
1205,"The present study aims at exploring the relevance of multimedia in general, and infographics, collages, and videos in particular. It was hypothesized that multimedia can enhance learning English because these are interesting tools that can attract learners and make learning easier and faster. This is a qualitative-desrcriptive study which elicited data from interviews conducted with teachers of king Abdulaziz university, Saudi Arabia. The research questions are based on the objectives of the study: 1) to elicit the perceptions of English language teachers on the relevance"
1206,"The current level of resource extraction, consumption and throughput to waste generation is a serious and global environmental issue (Haberl et al., 2019; Thøgersen, 2014). More sustainable approaches to using and managing materials and resources, including reducing use, are becoming increasingly important. The concept of a circular economy is one solution that can reduce negative environmental impacts while benefiting economy and society (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2013; European Commission, 2014; United Nations, 2015). In essence, circular economy involves reframing the way resources are used and managed (Wastling et al. 2018). The transition to a circular Economy will require significant change at all stages of the economy (MaitreEkern,"
1207,"Why are adolescents drawn to certain occupations is a question that continuously attracts researchers and practitioners alike. It is of high importance because it not only addresses the reproduction processes of social inequality but the chances of adolescents to aspire an occupation that fits their vocational interests. Research has shown that a successful fit between vocational interests and matching occupations has a tremendous impact on people’s lives. The reason for this lies not alone in labor-market barriers but in the adolescents’ vocational interests that are linked to occupations that do not match their gender or social class. Using data from the German Microcensus this study provides information about the gender composition, social class (socio-economic status and educational composition) of almost all occupations in Germany.

1208,"Asadora dramas have become increasingly popular in Japan in recent years, particularly in the wake of NHK’s “Waga Uta Boogie Woogie” (1987) musical, which has been produced several times, as well as cover versions of “Chidorin Diary” and “Tokyo Boogie“. Kasagi Shizuko is one of the most well-known of these asadora heroines, but her life story has been largely unknown outside of Japan. This article presents a detailed narrative of her life based on a wide range of Japanese primary and secondary sources. It will provide both Japanese and non-Japanese viewers of the drama with the background needed to"
1209,"The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is an academically challenging curriculum for students completing their final two years of secondary education that prepares them for success at university and life beyond (IB, 2022b). The IBDP plays a significant part in a student's journey toward successful acceptance into institutions of higher education internationally. The current study will demonstrate the development of a language learner identity in the IBDP. The study was conducted at a private secondary school in Istanbul (UAA, 2022). The high school is a one-way dual language Turkish/English learning environment. Upon acceptance to the school, students are tested with the Versant English Placement Test (VEPT: Pearson, 2022) and"
1210,"COVID-19 pandemic is affecting many aspects of the society, economy and the way people live. It is also disrupting the process of physical planning and development in the cities. It will perhaps permanently change the way planners and policy makers think about the city and plan for its development. The residents and visitors will also find the city to be different from the pre-COVI-19 era. The emerging situation would likely require new ways of moving, working and living in the city, and building the different physical components of the city."
1211,"Sport and non-sport activities combine to chiefly develop the personal competencies of their participants. All programmes can be connected to at least two specific competencies highlighted in the GIZ framework. In addition, all programmes target at least some form of professional competencies or skills and most address at least one social or methodological competence. As illustrated in Table 5, self-confidence and goal orientation are the main competencies addressed by other programmes, whereas critical thinking, creativity and empathy seldom appear. In terms of sports used, programmes often use a mix of sport or fitness activities , while others use specific activities such as CrossFit , rugby or basketball. Non-Sport activities predominantly focus on formal workshops and training opportunities related to general life or"
1212,"This study presents findings from an e-tandem project organized by language teachers from Cornell University (USA) and the University of Paris Nanterre (France). This program was implemented at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, during a period in which France was still in lockdown and American universities were struggling to stay open. Many university courses were forced online, with teachers often receiving minimal training. For many students, these online courses meant long hours of staring at a screen and listening to lectures, with additional written work and few opportunities to interact with their peers. The interactive activities and collaborative tasks that are the hallmark of a good language course had all but disappeared. In online courses, the opportunities for authentic language use are greatly"
1213,"The rapid evolution in information and communication technology offers students ample opportunities for personalised learning mainly because of its interactive and dynamic nature. Students can now access rich multimedia content, vast online resources, social networking tools, or digital games to make their learning more engaging and independent. As the growth and development of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) have influenced every field of education, it now plays a significant role in second language acquisition. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has recently become an area of interest among researchers in ELT to investigate the effectiveness of ICT integration in second-language acquisition and learners’ Perceived Use (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) of various online learning"
1214,"Education is necessary for achieving long-term sustainability and gender equality. It is the comprehensive basis for educational opportunities that the learners, with the help of teachers, should benefit from and build their personalities so that they develop their scientific and cognitive careers to meet the requirements of life. In the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), teachers consider textbooks as the basis for their teaching and learning. Textbooks are essential in EFL teaching since they are the primary source of information about the target language’s culture and values. In Saudi Arabia, the textbook is the most influential source of knowledge in the classroom in a nation like Saudi Arabia (Bawazeer, 2015). Despite the ongoing assessments and considerable changes in Saudi"
1215,"Translanguaging is a common practice of multilingualism in English language learning. The main question of this research paper is the perceptions of drama students on the use of translanguaging in English literature classes at King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia. The researchers applied research data to find out how participants perceive the common practice, for English Language learning, socio-cultural values, and sociolinguistic purposes, that is within university education. The results of this study are expected to fill the knowledge gap about how the students perceive the use the L1 (Arabic) and L2 (English) language in English"
1216,"The Associative Diffusion Model proposes that culture diffuses primarily as associations between (categories of) people, objects, genres, and events actors pick up from the world due to their everyday experiences. In other words, culture reflects people’s learned associations of what goes with what. Recent cultural analyses have conceived these networks of associations between cultural elements as cultural schemas governing individual choices, attitudes, and decision-making. Such cultural associations are often facilitated by organizations working in multiple sectors as sites of interaction where culture is created, maintained, and matched."
1217,"English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers are no longer viewed as technicians who only acquire language-teaching tactics in pedagogical methodology courses and then apply them in their classrooms. The shift from the cultivation of English skills to a more sociocultural perspective, which stresses cross-cultural communication competence, has placed teacher identity at the center of language teaching and learning (Miller, 2009). Meanwhile, the development in constructivist education theory, the emphasis on the link between language skills, cognition, and the enhanced accessibility of free language learning resources online have further shifted the outer environment for EFL teachers. The rapid and significant shift in the external factors necessarily calls for the adjustment of EFL teacher’s internal understanding of"
1218,"This chapter explores how boundaries and moments of evaluation interact in a emerging research discipline. The aims are to specify an analytical perspective that can direct further inquiries and to provide a basis for future research by suggesting a focus on a particular construction of the object of analysis, a set of issues, and a group of interactions. As such, while it the discussion relies on empirical data, it does not attempt a systematic analysis or pretend to draw from an exhaustive dataset. This inquiry began with a seemingly straightforward empirical issue, necessary descriptive work in the service of a larger question: in the Swedish artistic research field as it stood in 2021, who were the “peers” in peer review? Another framing of this question could use insider/outsider"
1219,"In the past 75 years, under-five mortality rates have declined precipitously in low- and middle-income countries. However, we know little about how pervasive experiences of child mortality remain in these settings. Demographers tend to track child mortality conditions by calculating annualized death rates, paying little mind to how these annualized rates aggregate in the minds and lives of the surviving population. Experiencing a sibling's premature death is known to influence women’s behaviors and preferences even long after the death occurred. As such, this study has two empirical goals. First, it clarifies the prevalence of women in three birth cohorts (1960s, 1970s, and 1980s) in 50 low-and-middle-"
1220,"In the year ending June 2024, there were over 50,000 knife crimes recorded by police in England and Wales, and knives were the most popular weapon used in homicide. In 2019, Violence Reduction Units (VRUs) were introduced in the 18 police force areas with the highest rates of hospital admissions for knife crime injuries (Home Office 2022, 2023). The VRUs promote multi-agency approaches and data sharing, seek to engage young people, and commission evidence-based interventions. The limited evaluation of VRUs to date has produced mixed evidence, although no statistically significant reduction has been found for either homicide or hospital admissions with a sharp object that can be linked to VRU activities. Hospital admissions for violence have declined and there is a"
1221,"The study of state violence in post-conflict societies and state-building processes has been understudied for decades. This article reviews the literature on the dynamics of the monopoly of legitimate violence in the context of non-state armed actors. The research is based on a working definition of the oligopoly of violence as a tool to peripheral legitimacy that has evolved from the findings of several research inquiries. I define the peripheral legitimacy as a multilayered and parallel governance that is de facto imposed to a specific territory thanks to the recognition and legitimacy granted by a local population. In this case, the state authority recognizes parallel legitimacies and relies more or less long-term on the collaboration links"
1222,"Network science has many applications for archaeologists, and it can be particularly useful for breaking out of traditional spatial categories and examining data through new lenses (Feinman and Neitzel 2020; Holland-Lulewicz 2021). Multilayer network analysis combines multiple networks into one analytical framework (Kivel¨ et al. 2014). There is too much involved to model the material culture of even a technologically simple society, but certainly analyzing more than one type of material culture provides a more complete understanding of the social dynamics involved in the networks of interaction we wish to understand. Yet, there are few examples of multilayer networks in archaeology (e.g., Giomi 2022; Upton 2019) and none I am aware of"
1223,"Social action is situated in time and space. As such, coordination requires participants to “move together” both simultaneously and sequentially. Such coordination is not sustainable by explicit rules alone. Instead, such practices are sustained by participants’ embodied “know-how” enabling them to respond to the continuously unfolding temporal and spatial dynamics, which in turn makes their actions reliable information for other participants in the situation. As people observe others and participate in a social activity, they develop three types of nondeclarative associations: (1) procedural skill, (2) affective associations, and (3 conceptual the “Know-How” facilitating participation (discussed above). In some cases, “"
1224,"Translating from Chinese to foreign languages, especially English, has grown into an urgent issue in China since 2012. This research aims to understand English majors’ perceptions of this issue in the Chinese context. This paper will first review research on Chinese-English translation learning, translation competence, and perception, followed by an introduction to the methodology relating to participants, instruments, and research procedure. Subsequently, the results, discussion, conclusion, and implications of the research will be presented. This study focuses on two research questions: 1) How do English majors perceive C-E translation learning and competence, including its importance, purposes, interests, challenges, and methods? and 2)"
1225,"There is consistent evidence that the neighborhood children grow up in has a causal effect on school achievement and other life chances. However, while these and other experimental and quasi-experimental studies have provided strong support for causality, they have come at the expense of more nuanced perspectives on heterogeneity in neighborhood effects. Scholars from various disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, economics, and quantitative genetics, have argued that neighborhoods affect different individuals in different ways as a function of their individual and family characteristics. In this paper, we examine whether the impact of neighborhood socioeconomics on children’s 5th-grade test scores in reading and math depends on gender, family socio-economics, and within-family genetics. Our registry data include"
1226,"Socioeconomic homophily can be the outcome of several co-occurring processes. Researchers commonly distinguish between those pertaining to an intrinsic attraction toward similar others, and those related to external constraints and opportunity structures. In this study, we propose to address these two issues by studying adolescent relationships in an unusual context. More specifically, we consider the case of a three-week summer camp in France. This camp constitutes an environment free of the usual school-year constraints of school, activities and parents, and gather teenagers from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, who do not know each other outside of this context. It therefore provides an opportunity to observe the sociability of adolescents in closed, well-bounded settings, with few unobserved foci, and"
1227,"The 2008 crisis significantly affected European labor markets until at least 2010, leading to prolonged impacts and in cases, hysteretic effects. However, not every region suffered the same. The Great Recession (GR), as well as the more recent COVID-19 crisis, have highlighted how systemic shocks have spatially unbalanced impacts both across and within countries. The frequency of these events makes more pertinent than ever the study of how regions can absorb and recover from a shock under the notion of regional economic resilience (Bailey et al. 2020). The flourishing research since 2008 has seen significant conceptual and operational developments and identified a range of resilience determinants spanning the micro to macro level from individual characteristics (Doran and Fingleton 2016"
1228,"People typically seek to fit in culturally with their social groups. Yet people vary considerably in how well they fit into and adapt to a given organization. How do people establish and maintain cultural fit in an organization and what are its behavioral consequences? Existing research offers two perspectives that have heretofore been conceptually disconnected. The first focuses on values. This line of work, echoing a long tradition in psychology and sociology, sees the locus of culture in the alignment between the values espoused by the individual-typically defined as relatively enduring beliefs about preferred modes of conduct (Rokeach 1973) and those that prevail in a group. Fitting in therefore implies having personal values that match those of other members. In contrast, the"
1229,"The CGIAR is a major player in the international agricultural R&amp;D domain in the Global South. It has released a new research strategy (3) towards its mission of ending hunger through science and innovation that advance transformation of food, land and water systems in a climate crisis. It sets out to deliver multiple benefits and transformative change across five SDG focused lenses or impact areas: Climate adaptation &amp; greenhouse gas reduction, nutrition, food security, poverty reduction, livelihoods, gender equality, youth and environmental health. The IMPACT model (International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade model) of the global agricultural economy is frequently used for foresight analyses in international agricultural research and development (R&"
1230,"Political violence based on partisanship can undermine the health and legitimacy of democracy. In this study, I investigate the effect of political violence on public opinion based on the assassination of the MP of the Labour Party, Jo Cox, in the United Kingdom. Using a natural experimental design, I find that immediately after the murder, feeling thermometer ratings among Conservatives toward the Labour party increased after the assassination. However, support for a non-incumbent party increases only among partisans who have negative attitudes toward the party. I do not find strong evidence that the empathy effect is strong enough to improve interpartisan hostility. Instead, I show that support for the Labour and Conservative parties, the two biggest parties in the UK, is as strong as"
1231,"Code-switching (CS) is a common phenomenon among bilingual and multilingual speakers in Saudi Arabia. The phenomenon has been described as a form of incompetence in one language and as a sign of language deficiency in the other. This study aimed to better understand the link between code-switched and language proficiency. The researcher used two main instruments: a questionnaire to obtain how Saudi female students at King Saud University (KSU) view the use of code- Switching, as an indicator of language proficiency"
1232,"Research on research integrity has estimated the prevalence of integrity violations in many subfields of science, including the social and behavioral sciences. According to the Netherlands Survey of Research Integrity (Gopalakrishna et al., 2022a), 50.2%) reported having engaged in at least one questionable research practice in the past two years. The most common questionable research practices are not submitting valid negative studies for publication and insufficient discussion of study flaws and limitations (17.2%). Two other frequently reported violations are inadequate note taking of the research process (14.4%) and selective citation of references to enhance findings or convictions (11%)."
1233,"In this digital age, libraries are increasingly important to American society. They are increasingly accessible to the general public, whether they be single parents seeking an affordable way to entertain the family, struggling students with work schedules that busy during normal daytime hours, or entrepreneurs looking to start a new business. Yet, libraries have largely embraced the internet and its expanded reach, and censor digital distribution networks has given out of the picture. These trends have led to unfortunate losses for reliable access to trustworthy information, which private markets simply do not have the financial incentives to provide. As like people take mobile wifi towards public service, always need-whether entrepreneurs starting their own businesses, single parents looking to entertain their children, or struggling students looking to learn, libraries"
1234,"Dividends are rewards paid to shareholders for their financial stakes and associated risk in an organization or business. According to well-known financial theory, managers have a duty to maximize shareholder value through efficient resource management. The company's dividend policy establishes the limitations, constraints, and rules necessary to allocate a company's net earnings between retained earnings and dividend payouts in order to maximize value. There are a broad range of factors, including the firm’s financial constraints, investment options, funding opportunities, quantities of funds necessary, stakeholder needs, firm size, and legal provisions, that are taken into account when deciding on a dividend policy. Such is the significance of dividend policy that the cascading effects of all of these components literally reach the"
1235,"The recent release of a random set of archived PowerPoints from U.S. government websites raises important questions for those interested in preserving born-digital government information. What kinds of publications are these? Do they contain substantial amounts of government information? What features of these files are useful to use to support future users accessing and discovering them in search systems? Along with those questions, the scale and extent of this content prompts new questions and issues for librarians and archivists. To what extent is metadata embedded in these files useful for describing/understanding them? Further, could this metadata be used to improve access to this material? The recent released set of PowerPoints offers an opportunity to explore exactly these kinds of questions."
1236,"The digital platform economy is one of the most significant developments of the 21st century. It has been described as a “revolution” (PARKER, GEOFFREY G.; ALSTYNE; CHOUDARY, 2016), “platform capitalism” and “surveillance capitalism“ (ZUBOFF, 2019), although presenting different nuances, highlight the role played by large private technology companies and call attention to the “ revolution” caused by platforms. Platforms have become a powerful force in the digital economy and social systems, but they are not neutral, affecting the functioning of both democracies and markets. By coordinating and managing markets, platform companies become a privileged point"
1237,"With the rapid development of FinTech, digital credit service has deeply integrated with information technology, and the issuing of digital credit products through the Internet channel is gradually becoming the mainstream in our daily life. It is only necessary for borrowers, who are also users of these platforms, to provide some personal information to apply for consumer credit services through these platforms without having to undergo a lengthy credit assessment. For instance, borrowers’ digital footprint s on the Internet, such as their browsing histories of web pages (Berg et al., 2020; Orlova, 2021), mobile phone usage histories (Bjšrkegren &amp; Grissen, 2020; Ma et"
1238,"Students with more cultural capital fare better in the educational system. However, while this research shows the relevance of an individual’s cultural capital endowment for success in school, it largely neglects the role of friends and peers in students’ educational careers. This aspect is highly important, since social relationships may contribute to inequalities between social groups (DiMaggio &amp; Garip, 2012). Therefore, this paper investigates the joint role of friendship relationships and cultural capital in educational inequality with regard to school grades"
1239,"Climate change is affecting all monitored dimensions of global health, with direct and indirect effects on human health. These impacts include injury, cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal health conditions, and death, as well as poor mental health and wellbeing, from non-optimal temperature, shifting weather patterns, and climate-related disasters. To prevent these impacts, adaptations in response to climate change need to take social vulnerabilities into consideration. This scoping review of the research literature concerning social indicators of vulnerability to the climate change impacts on health seeks to identify which indicators have been examined, and describes the key relationships between climate change, social vulnerability, and health. This review provides an overview of the empirical literature on social vulnerability to health impact of climate change from"
1240,"Integration of immigrants has been high on the policy agenda in many countries, including Finland, for several years. Integration is often characterised as a continuous two-way process, which requires commitment and action from both the individuals that have migrated and the receiving society. We study the process from the perspective of labour market integration in different immigrant groups, while also examining the role of socio-cultural resources, proxied by partnership with a native-born Finn. Therefore, we combine two strands of literature: one on the economic integration of immigrants and the other on interethnic marriages. We exploit the longitudinal format of Finnish register data to analyse development in earnings and employment among new immigrants, following them ten years after their entry to Finland. Such"
1241,"The sharing of research data is slowly becoming the norm across disciplines. Research funders such as the members of UK Research and Innovation in the United Kingdom (UKRI 2022), the European Union (European Commission 2016), the National Science Foundation (National Science Foundation 2011), and the National Institute of Health (NIH 2020) require sharing of data produced with their funding. More and more journals recommend or even require that data underlying empirical research are shared. This increase in requirements and willingness to share data has been accompanied by an expansion of the infrastructure for sharing data - the availability and range of data repositories and, in particular, the technologies offered by data repositories to protect sensitive data. In this paper, we seek to advance a better understanding of researchers"
1242,"As a sociocriminologist studying women’s prisons, I have contended that leisure needs to be rethought as a component of its environment and therefore as subjected to prisons’ functioning and goals (Marcoux Rouleau, 2020). In the following pages, I build on this to argue that despite its many benefits to incarcerated women and people in general, leisure has a limited capacity to fix that which is cracked and broken by the institution itself. Indeed, poverty, homelessness, victimization, and addiction are pathways to poor health and to criminalization, especially among women. Incarceration amplifies and creates issues with health and wellbeing, leading critical scholars to conclude that such problems are constitutive of the institution"
1243,"In the United States, there is an expectation that all individuals and institutions, including law enforcement, shall respect property rights and due process. Civil asset forfeiture without due process is one of the policies that American law enforcement agencies have used throughout the country and effectively abused while arguing that it allows for a more straightforward law enforcement process against drug lords and other malevolent individuals in society. Consequently, despite the advantages that some policies and legislation may provide to law enforcement and the government if they do not respect the fundamental civil rights of Americans, such laws and policies have to not only face opposition but must be repealed through the policy change process."
1244,"Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) once covered 92 million acres throughout the southeastern United States. However, longleaf currently covers less than 5 percent of its original native range (Oswalt et al. 2012). Decades of timber harvesting followed by conversion to agriculture, urban development, fire suppression, or planting other pine and hardwood species have reduced longleaf pine"
1245,"People with diabetes are advised to engage in several self-management behaviors in order to improve their health outcomes. These include eating healthily (e.g., controlling carbohydrate intake), engaging in regular physical activity, taking medications as prescribed, monitoring blood glucose, and managing stress and mental well-being. We interviewed 21 people living with type 2 diabetes in the United States between May and June 2020. The objective of the interviews was to capture how people with diabetes make decisions regarding self- management behaviors (with a particular emphasis on healthy eating and exercise), and how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted their behaviors. In this article, we describe the challenges that patients reported with respect to maintaining physical activity and healthy eating behaviors during"
1246,"This study examines high-achieving students in Norwegian lower secondary schools who follow accelerated learning trajectories in mathematics, so-called fast-tracks. These fast- tracks 1 allow advanced students to take classes and exams in single subjects at a higher grade level than their current grade level. We examine the differences between regular and fast-track students’ academic achievements in mathematics. We do so to address whether and how fast tracks improve these high-performing students' learning and performance. These questions are essential because higher-performing"
1247,"In this paper, we examine the extent to which occupational and economic attainment originate in the same underlying characteristics that make up a person’s family background. We extend previous research using sibling correlations to gauge the overall impact of family background and local community by considering how sibling correlations in different labor market outcomes overlap. We analyze brother data from Denmark and the United States and quantify the degree to which the unmeasured family background factors that affect attained occupational status also affect attained income in the two countries. We find that while the correlation in occupational status is identical in the countries (35 percent) and wages are much larger in the U.S. than in Denmark (50 compared to 30 percent), the overlap in wages"
1248,"Anthropological and archaeological investigations of violence focused on evolutionary origins before turning toward ecological explanations. One important realization that emerged from these research lines, though, is the slim likelihood that any single process led to an outbreak of violence. Many scholars now recognize that a holistic approach (i.e., Keeley 1996) that emphasizes the unique historical processes present in each region (for example Thorpe 2005) is a more reasonable tactic for examining the causes and consequences of violence in the past. Little research has been conducted on the relationship between violence and migration during the actual migration processes. Yet, there is some evidence, however, that some evidence that could result in the outbreak of migration itself could be the practice of violence between migrants and the"
1249,"Stigma and discrimination can have serious health consequences in a disaster, emergency, or pandemic. In this study, we examine the role of stigma and discrimination during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the context of the WHO’s response to the pandemic, which has been linked to a wide range of forms of discrimination, including racial and ethnic discrimination, age discrimination, and age-based discrimination. We find that stigma is associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and that age discrimination has been associated with poorer mental health during the outbreak. However, evidence suggests that age-related discrimination is not simply associated with dying older, but rather with being stigmatised or presumed to"
1250,"Offshore wind projects (OWPs) are on the rise. By 2019, OWPs had been constructed in 18 coastal states, and at least 17 other countries are planning to build OWPs in the near future. Although OWPs help slow down climate change by producing clean energy, they also have an impact, both positive and negative, on fish and the overall marine environment as a result of the construction and operation of wind turbines, and the way these turbines are decommissioned. Thus, the development of OWPs challenges the sustainability of marine fisheries and the integrity of marine ecosystems, particularly with the changing conditions that result from climate change."
1251,"Ahdaf Soueif’s The Retuning (1983) is one of the most influential novels of the 20th century. The paper examines the use of memory and time shift in the short story, The Returning, which is selected from her first collection of eight short stories entitled Aisha (1983). The first impression readers capture exploring The Returning is that Aisha is a sentimental and delirious female character and prisoner of a nostalgic past and memories, particularly of her husband. Aisha attempts to transcend her clichéd portrait that is labeled inferior, and weak and therefore, releases her story from the dizziness of a lost past. This transformation freed her from sheer delirium and backward"
1252,"Translating reading comprehension passages from the target language (English) into the native language (Arabic) before carrying out reading comprehension tasks resulted in a statistically significant performance difference between two groups of female learners learning English as a foreign language. In this context, the present study aims to understand the role of translation across native language and target language in supporting the foreign language learning process. The research question that guided this study was as follows: Does translating reading comprehension"
1253,"Reading a graph involves processing textual and numerical elements, such as labels, labels, and axis values, as well as visual elements such as shapes, lines, and colors. People’s abilities for close graph reading are referred to as graph literacy [Curcio, 1987]. It involves the skills to read the data by deriving the correct values from the graph, to read between data by comparing two points in the graph and to read beyond the data, and to make an estimation of unpresented data based on the graph. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to explain the process of reading and understanding graph design and its design principles. We show that graph design standards were developed over time, which people learn"
1254,"Organizational stigma is defined as “a label that evokes a collective perception that the organization is deeply flawed or discredited” (Devers, Dewett, Mishina, &amp; Belsito, 2009: 155). Such a perception can arise because of a one-time event, such as fraud or a scandal. Alternatively, organizational stigma can be a byproduct of firm behavior, and specifically of activities that are characterized by broad social disapproval. These forms of stigma-referred to as either core (Hudson, 2008) or categorical (Piazza, 2015; Vergne, 2012) in the literature-tend to be especially enduring, as they arise from sustained organizational engagement in practices that"
1255,"Environmental problems are largely caused by human actions; therefore, changing public behaviour is an essential step for successful conservation. To motivate public engagement with this issue, conservationists may use “framing” (a communication device used to emphasise specific aspects of a message). Two approaches to this in conservation communications include using types of value-framing (where the extrinsic or intrinsic value of biodiversity is emphasised) and message valence (where positive or negative outcomes of engaging with a subject are highlighted). We conducted a real-world online fundraising campaign (run across five countries, and focusing on the Western Ghats) on social media to examine how types of"
1256,"Inquiry-based learning (IBM) is an inquiry-based approach to learning English. The study adopts the Oxford University Press methodology of teaching English with IBM that showed positive results in the primary and secondary students’ acquisition of the target language. Students learn something about specific content, but more importantly, they develop an understanding of similar events by linking past and new experiences. They work in collaborative and cooperative groups to identify what else they need to learn to solve a problem and gain necessary research skills. The research aims to describe the experimental implementation of IBM combined with communicative approach in the process of English language acquisition by Ukrainian university students in terms of technology-enabled learning."
1257,"Violence against Women (VAW) is a violation of human rights and a global health problem. It involves physical, sexual, and psychological acts of violence that happen randomly or in long-term abuse. In Iraq, where harsh socio-economic conditions resulted from economic sanctions (1990-2003) during Saddam Hussein’s regime, and the US war in 2003 and its aftermath have affected women and gender relations severely, leading Iraqi women"
1258,"Despite the recent challenges with the pandemics, urbanization is a strongly ongoing megatrend that emphasizes the increasingly critical role of cities in the search for sustainability, and their significance in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 (United Nations, 2022). Cities also posit themselves as active players, or in other words, as solutions to multiple problems related to economic, social and ecological sustainability (e.g. Angelo &amp; Wachsmuth, 2020). In practice, the urban sustainability agenda is implemented through urban planning and policies, touching very centrally the residents and neighborhoods where they live in. To create sustainable strategies for attractive neighborhoods and to follow up if they induce desired effects, quantitative understanding"
1259,"Though English is a compulsory subject at schools in Oman, mastering writing skills in English poses a challenge to students in higher education. English is the medium of instruction, and the ability to write in EFL/ESL is a significant factor in language acquisition and learning. It is argued that writing is not a natural activity; it is a cognitive activity characterized by complexity in which"
1260,"In applied behavior analysis (ABA) journals, as few as 20% of published authors from 1978 to 1997 were female, indicating inequity between men and women publishing in the field. Although the numbers showed an increasing percentage of female authors across their research, the authors suggested two reasons as to why the discrepancy remained. First, the sex of the journal's editor at the time of publication was strongly associated with the rate of women published. Second, there is a solid glass ceiling preventing women from publishing at similar rates to their male counterparts (McSweeney et al., 2000). A glass ceiling describes the experience of a woman in a male-dominated field being prevented from promotion, authority, raises, etc. compared to her male"
1261,"Social studies of algorithms have acknowledged the fluidity and assembled nature of algorithms, at the same time as the field has lamented the inscrutability and power of the algorithm. In debates about the theory and methods of social studies of algorithm, there exists an oscillation-often in the same papers-between acknowledging the fluidy, complexity and assembled characteristics of algorithms (Seaver, 2017, 2018), and on the other hand a notion of algorithms as stable and delineated objects, existing out there, that can be unfair, unaccountable, opaque, and biased, and in the need of auditing in order to rectify said biases. My argument is that this oscillation in how algorithms are understood analytically-on the one"
1262,"Teacher education is considered as an important part of the education system since it is assumed to influence the quality of the educational setting and learners. Therefore, teachers play a key role and teacher education is important for every country (Azar, 2011; Instefjord &amp; Munthe, 2016; Rafique, 2014). In almost every country, it is carried out by higher education institutes such as universities within internship programs. In Turkey, pre-service teachers in the final year of their education are assigned to schools for 13 weeks and they practice teaching under the supervision of a mentor teacher. During this period, they get regular feedback from both their mentor teachers and faculty instructors regarding their teaching performances. The relevant literature shows"
1263,"Italy was one of the first countries in Europe to import cartoons and full-length animated films from Japan and anime's success was immediate, to the extent it could be considered as a sort of love at first sight. Anime and manga have contributed to shape the audiovisual background of many Italian children and teenagers, thanks also to the weird show schedule on TV. There is also nostalgia towards the anime of the past and their TV opening and ending theme songs, especially amongst people in their thirties who used to be children at the time of the second wave of anime in Italy, and it is easy to assess the success of films by Studio Ghibli, which have been loved both by children and adults alike."
1264,"Between 1789 and early 1794, France embarked on a rights expansion that was unprecedented, not just in French history but in world history, as well. In that brief period, despite opposition from a large swath of the population, France outlawed the slave trade, emancipated the Jews, formally abolished serfdom, established civil divorce, gave equal rights to Protestants, and decriminalized homosexuality. It eliminated monopolies, arbitrary arrests, and hereditary privileges and instituted freedom of commerce and expression. The legislative changes during the French Revolution are a microcosm of a global rights expansion. In countries around the world, groups that were previously denied equivalent moral standing-including propertyless men, women, ethnic and religious minorities, homosexuals,"
1265,The need to revisit Castle in the Sky is made obvious by the fact that there are still arguments over whether or not it is actually Studio Ghibli’s first film. The debate is first seen in critical accounts when Helen McCarthy declares that after the success of Nausicaä of the Valley
1266,"FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is a negative, affective experience that occurs when consumers feel excluded from their peers and friends. FOMO is associated with a variety of negative emotions, including fear of missing out, envy, and anticipated regret. We argue that individuals’ susceptibility to experiencing these cognitions forms a personality trait indicative of an individual’s susceptibility to experience FOMOs more often. In this study, we examine how consumers’ proneness to FOMOS, anticipated regret, and envy affect their decision-making process. We find that consumers who are dispositionally concerned about their inclusionary status within their peer group are more likely to experience"
1267,"Mentocracy is an ideal that aspires to the distribution of resources in a society according to personal effort and talent. This ideal is widely found in modern societies, where it is raised as a legitimate way to progress individually based on personal achievements, and therefore contrasts with the use of family privileges and personal contacts to get ahead. However, the implementation of meritocratic systems is far from being unproblematic. It has been argued that meritocracy allows thelegitimization of inequalities by attributing success to personal achievement, thus underestimating the conditions of origin or the 'starting point' (Bay-Cheng, 2015; Hadjar, 2008). This implies great psychological and social pressure on young people, who regardless of the"
1268,"This article explores the role of caucus fundraising in the assignment process of House Energy and Commerce Committee seats. I use data on legislators’ committee requests and assignments from the 110th Congress to determine whether top contributors are more likely to be placed on committees that they requested, or if they are placed on important committees they requested. I find that members who give more money to their party’s reelection efforts are likely to receive more committee assignments than those who give money to independent committees. These results challenge the theory that strong fundraisers are strategically placed on committee assignments rather than given committee assignments that they request, and that they operate the committee assignments"
1269,"The Solutrean site of Landry in Dordogne, France, was excavated by one of us (MB) in 2011. The site features several levels of aeolian silts overlying a low alluvial terrace of the Isle River. Aeolian Silts cover the layer on which the hunter-gatherers settled. The geologists found five distinct concentrations of artefacts spread over 117 300 m² in different excavated sectors, interpreted as resulting from different activities taking place during the same occupation. As many as 106 lustrous gravels were retrieved in the sieving from sector 3 and, to 127 a lesser degree, from sector 2 (Figs 1 and 3). Those"
1270,"In many parts of the world, groundwater resources support the livelihoods of the communities and sustain human health. The availability of groundwater is influenced both by natural factors such as spatial distribution of rainfall patterns across and the heterogeneous geology, soil, and topographical characteristics (Prajapati et. al., 2021). Precipitation helps in recharging groundwater through seepages into the ground. However, in the urban areas, when an intense rainfall occurs within a short interval, it fails to seep into underground natural reservoirs due to impervious built-up areas. The rainwater does not reach the aquifers, nor it gets out as baseflow, but it directly flows to streams and rivers as a surface"
1271,"In The Sky Crawlers, the Kildren are a race of beings who exist in a liminal state not unlike that of adolescence, and many of their character traits - recklessness, inability to think outside of the present, and an inability to fully understand the consequences of their actions - are attributed to that state. While their ages are uncertain, the film itself is purposefully vague in revealing the characters’ exact ages, if they can even be said to have exact ages. They frequently refer to themselves as kodomo (kids), often ironically, and other characters also call them “kids” and comment on their “immaturity” or weep at the loss of a “poor boy�"

The image of the weather vanes is derived from the cockerel attached to the roof of the building formerly known as Thomas House in Kitanochō, Kobe, also known as the ‘Kazamidori ('weather vane') house’, which was the origin of the drama’"
1273,"Metaphor is a vital technique for uncovering identity that can give unique insights compared to other identity-related approaches, including interviews, journal reflections, and narrative inquiry. Metaphors, in this sense, serve as instruments for critical thought. They assist us in comprehending aspects of experience, such as teaching and learning, that are difficult to understand in their own right. As a result, metaphors are recognized as an archetype of teacher identity in addition to serving as proxies for professional thought (Fenwick, 2013; Saban 2006).Metaphors are culturally unique since they rely on shared understandings."
1274,"Affective polarization in Western democracies is increasingly shaped by distrust and hostility across party lines. This affective polarization may prompt reluctance to have partisan opponents as neighbours, co-workers, or family members, discrimination against partisan opponents in economic transactions, and even the willingness to undermine democratic processes and condone violence in pursuit of political objectives. Affective polarization is usually measured by comparing partisans’ feelings towards their own party versus their (frequently negative) feelings towards political opponents. While such “feelings-based” measures seem sensible for explaining 1 some political phenomena, other social and economic consequences often linked to affective"
1275,"Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019. It then spread to other countries in late 2019 and 2020, affecting people worldwide, posing severe global health concerns, and adversely impacting the health, economy, and well-being of almost every country across the globe, including India. The pandemic disrupted the lives of many, specifically the transgender community. According to the 2011 census in India, there are around 4.88 lakh transgender people with 55 thousand children as reported by their parents. The transgender community is traditionally stigmatized and marginalized in India (Dasgupta et al., 2021) and faces the consequences of the economic challenges that the pandemic posed."
1276,"This study analyses time-dated phylogenies from the lexical cognate data of 34 Uto-Aztecan languages. We used Bayesian phylogenies based on Bayesian clustering with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in BEAST v.2.4.1 (Bouckaert et al. 2014, Drummond &amp) and LingPy v.6.9 (List &amp; Forkel 2022b), LingRex v1.3.0 (List andamp), LingPy (List) and Zenodo v.10.5281/zenodo.com/lexibank/utoaztecan.

1277,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected students’ learning at different levels because of the full closure of schools and universities globally. In Saudi Arabia and other countries, there was a transition to embrace online learning as a solution to prevent the spread of the disease and to ensure the continuity and flexibility of learning. However, there are many educational issues that have to be reconsidered as a result of the rapid transition to online learning including but not limited to methods of teaching and learning, language learning activities, technical problems that students encounter, lack of social interactions, cheating among students and assessment tools. What makes the situation worse is that the experience of online learning and assessment was new to both teachers and students."
1278,"This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the study of parliamentary systems in the context of the French parliamentary system. It is the first study to examine the role of cultural factors in the analysis of parliamentary processes. The study is based on a cross-sectional analysis of French parliamentary systems. The findings show that legislative studies tend to be resistant to comprehensive approaches, particularly in the fields of political and legal sciences, which are dominated by the political and juridical sciences. In particular, legislative studies are resistant to the development of comprehensive approaches to the study and analysis of political life in the centres of democratic power. Here, I argue that the main reason for this resistance is the lack of a comprehensive approach in the field of legislative studies."

1280,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economies and societies worldwide. One of the most critical ways in which it has affected the economic activity and security of individuals has been through the impact of measures affecting the workplace: the International Labour Organization estimates that, as of April2020, m ore than 80% of the world’s workforce was affected by full or partial lockdown measures. Many governments have recommended or even mandated remote work, thereby making the feasibility of adapting work arrangements to home settings a critical element in ensuring business and employment continuity during the pandemic (International Labour Organization, 2020). Our article aims to study the antecedents of working from home (WFH) as a consequence of"
1281,"In January 2021, nearly one year following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a mandate requiring all people in the United States to wear face masks on all “conveyances into and within the U.S”. The CDC’s ability to issue this mandate was made possible by powers enumerated to the Department of Health and Human Services (of which the CDC is a subsidiary) under the Public Health Service Act of 1944. These powers include not only the ability to declare a public health emergency in the face of threats from infectious disease, but to take “such action as may be appropriate to respond to the public Health emergency” (42"
1282,"Lolita is a way of life, a philosophy or a feeling close to the heart with an emphasis on understanding and advancing a personally defined concept of beauty. Lolita combines an appreciation of kawaii with shōjo sensibility. Shōjo is “not so much a literal description of any individual girl’s consciousness” as a “cultural logic” accessible to writers and artists and the people who enjoy these works. It provides a valuable resource and common language for certain kinds of expression in literature and art that convey senses of liminality and distance from the conventional gender lines of Japanese society in covert feminist"
1283,"Since the 1980s, U.S. immigration policy has taken a repressive turn: while employers of undocumented immigrants have been largely sheltered, anti-immigrant animus targeting undocumented immigrants has spawned a series of measures heightening the vulnerability of a much broader foreign-origin population. Given the size of the undocumented population, full-scale removal exceeds the capacity of the American state. Thus, while any individual undocumented immigrant is at relatively low risk of deportation, every undocumented immigrant"
1284,"As language users, our voice is crucial in establishing and negotiating our identities. The process of writing in a second language is by itself a challenging task, but it is more challenging to adhere to more nuanced conventions such as voice. The rise of social media and global digital connection have reshaped our perceptions and articulation of our selves and the world. The impact of this connectivity encourages us, as researchers, to examine the voice in the writing of new generations of Arab learners of English as a second Language Learners (SLL). Since English and Arabic languages represent different societies and distinct cultures and have divergent value systems, we have come to realize the significance of pinpointing the impacts of these differences on writing for both learners and educators"
1285,"TikTok videos became popular as a medium at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many discovered the app as a way to alleviate boredom and virtually live social lives under lockdowns and restriction to public spaces. Migrant domestic workers were not exempt from this social media trend. In August 2020, the New York Times published a feature of one such worker from Kenya, Brenda Dama. One of her videos garnered nearly one million views, liked over 143 000 times, and has nearly 5000 comments. In the video, she looks at her mobile phone camera directly as text captions and background music tell us what it is like for her to work in Saudi Arabia. The captions that read “ Freedom , and �"
1286,"A textbook is crucial in any language teaching program since it represents the primary source of the required linguistic information to be taught to language learners. A textbook must fulfill several conditions and have specific thematic elements that must appear in every aspect of the textbook fabric (Tomlinson, 2001). These aspects must be carefully considered and well covered in each textbook. This current research aims to evaluate a book titled Nursing One . The researchers have endorsed this E.S.P. textbook for teaching Medical English to premedical students at Umm-Al-Qura University (U.Q.U.) since 2014. Textbook evaluation practice has begun to occupy a more expansive space in the realm of English Language Teaching literature. The primary goal of"
1287,"Information about public leadership is primarily collected through survey methods. Surveys are useful for several reasons, including the ability to obtain information about variables that are difficult to observe directly, the consistency of measurement within and across studies, and the efficiency of gathering data on a large number of leaders or followers. However, in survey data, nonresponse is always an issue, and we know almost nothing about the representativeness of the collected data in leadership studies. Nonresponse is an important issue because selection bias in survey-based leadership studies can threaten the inferences made from such studies. The literature on nonresponse in surveys has shown that factors such as interest in the survey topic and motivation can not only influence response rates but also lead to nonresponse"
1288,"Machine Translation (MT) is a relatively new and under-researched study area, especially in audiovisual contexts. This study addresses the following research questions: (i) to evaluate the accuracy of Google Translate when used for the translation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) subtitles through error annotation and (ii) to examine the comprehensibility of the selected machine-translated MOOC subtitles among female users through a quasi-experiment. Using a mixed methods approach, this study addressed the following questions: What types of accuracy errors can be identified in Google Translated’s EnglishArabic translation of MOOC"
1289,"Do violent conflicts increase people’s religiosity, and if so, why? Several studies found that individuals more exposed to violent conflicts where they live are more religious, even years after the conflict ended. In this study, we provide rigorous evidence for the conflict-religiosity hypothesis and the strong version of insecurity/evolutionary theories. We test the sociotropic threat mechanism and find that violent conflicts"
1290,"The study of the seven-building task is essential because it exposes how language is utilized in the political discourse to build certain functions and influence public opinion. We create or construct things in the world via language. So when we speak or write, we frequently create or build seven things or seven aspects of “reality” Gee (2011) calls them the “seven building tasks” of language: significance, identities, practices, relationships, politics, connections, sign systems, and knowledge. Hence, this study is aimed to examine how President Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia in terms of the two-building tasks, namely, significant, identity and identity according to Gee‌‌ ‌ �"
1291,"This study examines the effects of Code-Switching (CS) and Target-Language-Only (TL-only) instruction on reading comprehension in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes in Saudi Arabia. It also aims at examining their preferences for CS or TL-only instruction used by their teachers and the reasons behind their preferences. The findings show that CS is preferred by the majority of the female EFL college reading comprehension beginners, while TL-Only learners prefer CS. The study also shows that CS and TL- only instruction are beneficial for reading comprehension, especially for beginners."
1292,"In online communication, code-switching (CS) is an obvious phenomenon in various social media platforms. One of the popular platforms is Twitter (Sihombing &amp; Meisuri, 2014). Twitter offers people around the world the opportunity to create, send, and share short messages which are called Tweets. Through Tweets, the phenomenon of CS between languages occurs. This study aims therefore to investigate CS between Arabic and English languages among King Khalid University (henceforth KKU) students on social media “Twitter”. The study conducted a survey of Arabic students at the University of King Khalid (KKU), Saudi Arabia. The results of the study show that CS occurs among KK"
1293,"China had been contending with aggravating foreign threats and national crises since the late nineteenth century, especially after the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), when Chinese intellectuals realized that print media could be an effective way to stimulate nationalist feelings. In an advertisement promoting New Fiction ( Xin xiaoshuo), a leading literary journal founded by Liang Qichao in Japan in 1902, Liang listed the “story of sentiment” as one of the ‘new fiction” genres aimed at “evoking citizens’ political thoughts and inspiring their patriotic spirit” (Liang [1902] 1997: 41-45). A Reformist writer even argued that a ‘story of romantic sentiment"
1294,"Since the 1958 revolution that saw the defeat of its colonial oppressors, Iraq has continued to struggle to find its own cultural identity. In response to colonization, the Iraqi poet, Badr Shaker al-Sayyāb (1926-1964), a key founder of the Arabic Free Verse Movement, wrote the poem, “The Blind Prostitute.” This paper argues that an important effect of the ongoing interference and manipulation of Iraq’s national"
1295,"Previous research has examined how terrorist attacks influence a variety of societal outcomes, including public trust in government institutions. One of the more consistent findings is the collective increase in support for political institutions following attacks. There is evidence that attacks motivated by Islamic ideology are associated with stronger “rally” effects compared to other ideologies. In order to advance quasi-experimental research on the effects of terrorist attacks on institutional trust, we assess all jihadist terrorist attacks resulting in at least one civilian death in a country included in the European Social Survey (see Giani, 2021; Giani &amp; Merlino, 2021). Instead of pooling data prior to analysis, we systematically assess each case study separately, with attention to evaluating the assumptions relevant to"
1296,"The study is based on the experience of online assessment teachers teaching on a virtual platform using online tools called Blackboard and WhatsApp, a primarily used social media application. The study was conducted to understand teachers’ perceptions of technology-based language assessment, mainly based on more complex interactions offered during pandemics. The salient feature that was observed in online learning is the new form of academic discourse, peer and collaborative work, and students’ participation that builds trust, care, and confidence, keeping students motivated and engaged when there were reported cases of anxiety, loneliness, and depression in students due to pandemic crisis due to"
1297,"This study aims to explain and predict students’ desire to learn using quantitative empirical research that is yet to gain popularity in language research, that is, the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Three of the well-known factors that can affect students' desire to learning are their attitude towards the language, level of language anxiety and motivation in learning the language. Desire to learn is a latent variable that is difficult to observe directly. A number of studies have been done on motivation to learn, foreign language anxiety, and attitude towards foreign language. However, it is not known how strong do they explain the desire toLearn. Hence, this research is to determine the cause-effect"
1298,"Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States have signed an agreement to share nuclear-powered submarine technology with the US and UK. The AUKUS deal provides a framework for the acquisition of nuclear submarines by Australia, a non-nuclear weapons State, which raises a number of questions around the legal obligations regarding nuclear non-proliferation as well as the commitment in the Treaty of Rarotonga 3 for a nuclear-free South Pacific. The deal also promises to expand cooperation between the US, UK and Australia to include cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities. In the short term, the capabilities of militaries to surveil and patrol maritime spaces will be significantly increased. Uncrew"
1299,"Political discourse has become one of the core of international communication. The key to the translation of political discourse (TPD) is how to do the perlocutionary act so that the target text could effectively influence the concepts, decisions, and acts of the international recipients (Yuan, 2020). Furthermore, TPD emphasizes the truthful delivery of the TT and the intended communicative effect on the target audience (TA) since the international audiences are expected to “hear, “understand, and “accept” China through the translated text. In this regard, understanding the features of translating China’s political discourse from Chinese to English is of great help to political translators and researchers in studying the problems and"
1300,"Japanese popular culture (JPC) is a global phenomenon that has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in Australia. JPC consumers play multiple roles as fans, students and producers of Japanese cultural content particularly in online activities. It is not difficult to imagine that popular culture finds its way from entertainment to the education arena. This study examines the impact of JPC on Japanese language education in Australia, focusing on the Japanese language as the most commonly taught foreign language (FL) from primary to tertiary institutions with approximately 300,000 learners in 2015 (JF 2016). Japanese is by far the most taught language other than English (LOTE) in Queensland and have the highest number of Japanese learners alongside Victoria (Spence-Brown"
1301,"In the last two decades, the study of teacher cognition has emerged in the field of teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language (EFL). Several studies have investigated teacher cognition regarding their teaching practices of planned instructions of teaching such as teaching grammar and reading instruction; while others have investigated unplanned instructions such as Corrective Feedback (CF). However, very few studies explore tacit beliefs (unconscious/ implicit beliefs) of teachers about their CF practices to help teachers grow professionally. Moreover, in line with the development of today’s world in technology, teacher feedback has also moved beyond the traditional to an online setting. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to explore teachers’ tacit beliefs and practices regarding online corrective feedback in"
1302,"There is a broad consensus on the importance of carbon pricing programs in the economic decarbonization path and for climate mitigation policies. Carbon pricing is one of the tools of the environmental policies necessary to reduce emissions; it can also be a source of revenue and a competitiveness lever and can be a valuable means to promote efforts in employing the best available technologies. However, the carbon price is often deemed under optimal value. The gap between carbon prices worldwide and the prices needed to meet climate mitigation goals could be closed by improving the public acceptability of carbon prices through the appropriate use of revenue (Klenert et al., 2018). Among the main environmental policies, a prominent carbon pricing tool is the emission trading system (ETS) mechanism (Ver"
1303,"Research funding has become a complicated issue across many fields of contemporary science. Public research funding particularly has undergone major changes, primarily in Europe, but also beyond. New directions are pursued in research governance and funding policies, and in the way public ministries and funding agencies handle policy instrument design and resource allocation. There is also increasing diversification and hybridity in how scientific and societal objectives are pursued through public research funding programmes at national and supranational levels. For individual researchers, these multi-layered changes percolate through, to make their funding situations also more complicated. Researchers may have to engage with more varied funders, funders’ aims and funding forms. In this chapter, we present two new frames to attempt"
1304,"The purpose of translation is to duplicate various types of texts in another language, including religious, literary, scientific, and philosophical texts, to make them more accessible to a broader audience. As a result, literary translation has become one of the most critical issues in translation studies in recent years. The changing nature of literary translation requires the development of new translation procedures and adjustments in reader expectations, and the integration of new aesthetic concepts. In this paper, I present a new approach to literary translation based on the concept of equivalence levels. I introduce the use of linguistic corpora, a corpus-based approach based on a corpus of literary translations, and introduce a new literary translation equivalence approach. I also present a case study of the"
1305,"Idols are omnipresent in Japan, one would almost forget that these idols are, first and foremost, singers and dancers. The fact that idols are so omnipresent and idol-groups endlessly proliferate has not escaped the attention of scholars around the world. Exploring this aidoru genshō (Idol phenomenon), scholars underline three important facets that characterize these energetically dancing and singing girls. The first characteristic concerns the fact that idol-images are, in essence, images. The second characteristic scholars have sufficiently explored concerns the role of the jimusho, i.e. the performer management companies that dominate and structure the Japanese entertainment industry. The third characteristic is that the idols are usually not extraordinarily talented"
1306,"In Jordan, English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students received online learning to enhance its points of strength and address its challenges, the researchers applied TAM constructs and two external variables. The researchers assumed that the EFL learners’ previous experience in online learning had a positive impact on their attitudes and behavioral intentions to use online learning. They found that the greater the online learning experiences of users, the stronger their intention to use an online learning community. Furthermore, the characteristics of online learning as an Information System (IS) are defined in this research by the features this system offers to assist the online user of the learning system. This study is believed to be the first on EFL students using online learning, in the context of"
1307,"Biodiversity loss is one of the most pressing issues of our time due to its vast scale and significant detrimental impacts on people and nature. However, only developing knowledge about how to conserve biodiversity is not enough as effective biodiversity conservation practice relies on both the development and dissemination of salient (i.e., relevant and timely) and credible knowledge and on its deployment to improve conservation practices. Knowledge exchange is central to these processes. When both academics and practitioners engage effectively in knowledge exchange, it can bolster the usefulness of research for purposes beyond academia (Ray, 1999, Van de Ven, 2017). However, inadequate academic-practitioner knowledge exchange persists for work on biodiversity conservation (Whitten et al., 2001, Gossa et"
1308,"Webtoons, which are commonly referred to as webcomics in the English language, have been a staple of online Korean popular culture for over a decade, having first appeared in the early 2000s as personal blog or online journal entries that the artists would draw in short comic strip format. With the increase in artists drawing comics online, and with the sponsorship of major websites (the most prominent being the web portals Naver and Daum) providing channels for these artists to regularly serialize their material, webtoons have since expanded their media presence in South Korean culture. With diversified content, ease of access, and greater profitability,"

The genre is performed traditionally by blind male practitioners (with yugu drum and clappers) on urban streets and in teahouses, in village squares and at temple fairs. It was hugely popular in the Jinhua region during the late Qing and early decades of the twentieth century. It experienced a vigorous if brief revival during the ‘spring wind’, which ensued in the folk arts with the advent of economic reform in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and"

The reservoir attracts visitors throughout the year, and a grand service is held annually on 8 May, the day of his death, to commemorate the engineer who, at the time, designed the largest reservoir in Asia. The commemoration service, held since 1947 by the local residents, had traditionally been a low-profile affair. Yet in recent years, it has turned into a high-profile national and international event, thanks to the power of popular culture and mass media. In present-day Taiwan, Hatta is a deity. To his worshippers, he is a miracle-maker who turned dry"
1311,"There are several models of collective problem-solving, including the NK Landscape, Hong-Page Model, and March's (1991) organizational learning model. These models assume a networked network of agents, each starting with a unique solution and searching individually via hill climbing while also sharing information with neighbors. The NK landscape was first formulated to characterize epistasis in gene regulatory networks (Kauffman &amp; Levin 1987; for a primer see Csaszar 2018).  Social scientists have used the NK landscape as a model of problem solving, where each of N bits represents the presence or absence of some solution element and the parameter K represents the number of interdependencies between those elements.

Peer review is either “single-blind,” in which reviewers are aware of the names and affiliations of authors, or “double-blind” wherein anonymity of authors and peer reviewers is maintained. This article presents the possibility of reducing scientific misconduct through retractions by a dual peer review system. First, have a double-blind peer review with anonymity on both sides since 71% have confidence in it. Second, peer reviewers should be used in the single-blind oral peer review by technology (zoom"
1313,"As time and technology progress, so too does the human ability to read emotion in written form, and this has affected the way people choose to communicate. As attention spans shorten (Mark et al., 2016) and we rush to email or text while multitasking, care in our verbiage may be increasingly lacking-especially given a tendency towards overconfidence in our ability to communicate clearly. This can have unfortunate and devastating consequences, including damage to friendships, romantic relationships, and even loss of one’s job and/or professional standing. Given the challenges of accurately interpreting the true meaning behind email-based communications, research has examined ways individuals attempt to clarify their messages. Emotional Intelligence Predicts Accuracy of Perceived Emotional Intent"
1314,"Waste management is a complex system, in which multiple services must be organized and coordinated in a way to reduce the environmental impact, for example, through activities aimed at promoting the reduction of waste production, as well as recycling, energy recovery, and the minimization of landfilling. To meet the increasing number of circular economic goals, countries worldwide are seeking to improve the efficiency of waste management markets in terms of environmental performance and cost efficiency. For this market to effectively move toward a more circular perspective, sound reforms are needed at the market design level. We suggest that a system operator should be introduced in the industry to coordinate and support the healthy functioning of the market. We develop our idea starting from lessons learned from the energy market"

How is this possible? How could these young, unprivileged men become so successful so rapidly? This question is a part of a more general question: why do some artworks – songs, books, movies, paintings – become successful while others do not? The emerging “science of culture” offers us two contesting explanations. First explanation: success in the arts results from luck and the related effects that amplify it, like the rich-get-richer effect. In this view, success – especially extreme"

The main character, The Outside, is a female American writer, who uses her plays to address the issues of gender equality and gender inequality. The study aims to identify the two female characters in The Outside as outsiders and strangers within their society. The data are collected through the close reading of The Outside , and observing and searching for patterns within the text, then the patterns are explored in the light of feminist theories. It shows how social convention and values have confined the woman. Moreover, women are torn between two"

The anthropologist is concerned with researching the relationships between non-human organisms and humans situated in the ‘human domain’. In the strict sense of the term, the latter could be metaphorically considered a ‘laboratory’ in which its relations of association between individual organisms are the main object of his/her study. In sum, the anthropologist studies the relationships of individual organisms, which are the “laboratories”"
1322,"Water is a critical element in arid and semi-arid landscapes, especially since it forms a limited resource tied deeply to human livelihoods, growth, and development. As such, water (presence or lack of) holds critical meaning and significance to individuals and communities living in these regions. groundwater was historically used as a buffer against rainfall variability but population growth, increased agricultural demand for water, increased incidences of drought and water scarcity have augmented the exploitation of groundwater reserves. India has seen more than five hundred percent increase in groundwater use in the past six decades and it is estimated that continued exploitation of India’s groundwater resources combined with increased rainfall variability will likely lead to a severe water crisis in the future, especially in the ar"
1323,"Popular culture has played a significant role in Japan and Asia in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and has contributed to globalization as well as localization in regional contexts. There have been studies of Japanese media cultural products in a variety of content and formats (Kelts 2007; Johnson-Woods 2010; Hamano 2005), but surprisingly little scholarly attention has been directed towards the phenomenon of adaptation and remaking of Japanese popular culture products for regional and global trade and the influence of this trade on regional audiences from a sociocultural viewpoint. The effects of these cultural transfers are determined using audience analysis to search for regional harmonization or hybridity. Some media products, such as Japanese manga and TV dramas, are remade outside"
1324,"This article addresses five common arguments against counting stillbirth as a more mainstream form of mortality within demography. These include: (1) stillbirth is too difficult to measure; (2) focusing on neonatal/infant mortality tells us enough about health and wellbeing; (3), stillbirths are already included in the perinatal mortality rate, which has existed for a long time; (4) they are more an outcome of fertility since it is similar to other kinds of pregnancy losses; (5) stillborn babies cannot be counted as deaths because they never entered the population; and (6) they can be emotionally sensitive or taboo. This section describes and critically analyzes five arguments that pervade current thinking about"
1325,"The purpose of this study is to examine Frost’s use of the techniques of modernist free verse. The objective is to realize and understand the devotion to rhythm, rhyme, meter, and line measurement in Frost's free verse poetry. The study is expected to develop the reader‌‌ ‌"
1326,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which started in early 2020, had already resulted in more than 100 million confirmed cases and two million deaths worldwide by the end of 2020. Large-scale social anti-contagion policies, such as the lockdown of cities, temporary closure of businesses, and prohibition of group gatherings, have been employed throughout the world to contain the spread of infection, through the reduction of people’s movements and contact. These policies inevitably have been accompanied by a deep recession in the world economy (OECD, 2020). This short-run trade-off between health and wealth polarized society into two: those who wish to control spread of the virus and those who emphasize the"
1327,"Cuteness is not merely a matter of individual taste, but rather is comprised of particular features: rudimentary criteria with a certain degree of flexibility. These include rounded physical features; infantilized or child-like body structures; and behaviours that convey a sense of simplicity, weakness and clumsiness (Lorenz [1950] 1971: 154). Considered together, these characteristics describe a non-threatening object that is in need of the subject’s care and attention. From teddy bears to video game characters, cute objects involve a stylization denoting a lovable personality. However, it is significant that a cute object often appears as a caricature of the human body rather than a direct replica of its biological form"
1328,"The spread of the recent COVID-19 pandemic affects higher education methodologies and impacts and modifies higher educational institutions’ methods, models, approaches, and even resources worldwide. In over 200 countries, on March 12, 2020, the provisional suspension of face-to-face teaching was announced to limit the spread of this deadly virus (UNISCO,2020). On the other hand, universities and institutions must pursue and finish their academic year’s agenda. Official correspondence from the Algerian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific research ordered its sector to shift toward online learning and provide the learners with courses on the official universities’ websites or some recommended educational platforms and set the end of March 2020 as a deadline for teachers"
1329,"Second generation youth with a nonEU background perform less well in education than non-migrant youth, as they obtain lower grades, have higher dropout rates, and pursue less often college or university. Most research findings indicate that these ethnic inequalities in education largely result from socio-economic background rather than an ethnic gap per se. Less is known about the magnitude and causes of “horizontal ethnic stratification”, i.e., ethnic differences in the choice for fields of study. This chapter contributes to the scant literature by examining the post-secondary and tertiary field of study"
1330,"Online Learning Management Systems (LMSs) have become the backbone of teaching and learning activities as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has disrupted genuine classroom sessions around the world. LMSs are used for more than just delivering learning materials; they also provide a platform for students to connect with one another and with their instructors, as well as the ability to submit assignments online, check grades, receive instructor feedback, and download learning materials. It's a Google Apps for Education feature that allows anybody with a Google account to create and take part in online learning platforms and courses. Students can also utilise GC to communicate with their ESL lecturers."
1331,"Lifespan inequality is arguably the most fundamental inequality as all other inequalities such as education and income inequalities are conditional upon being alive. Therefore, reducing lifespan inequality should be one of the most important public health goals. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to understand the sources of lifespan inequality. At the national level, a generally promising picture has been presented: as life expectancy increases, lifespan inequality decreases. It is less promising when taking a look at the subnational level. Life expectancy and lifespan inequality differ by gender, education, occupation, race/ethnicity, geographic location, etc. For instance, lower socioeconomic status has been consistently found to be associated with lower life expectancy and higher lifespan inequality (BrønnumHansen et"
1332,"Inequality in science, and in academia generally, persists within and between disciplines and along well-known axes. Gender is one of the most studied axes of inequality in science. This study extends prior work on metrics in science generally and the h -index specifically by conceptualizing the inequality process as occurring via intra-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary dynamics. Variation in the h-index may result from “apples-to-oranges” comparisons across disciplines and fields due to specific factors, like gender and sole authorship, but also occur within disciplines, as scholars experience differing publishing trajectories dependent on gender"
1333,"In recent years, there has been an increase in Cooperative Learning (CL) studies to improve classroom teaching and learning. This study investigates the students’ attitudes towards the Group Investigation CL model after being applied to English School Projects. The study is based on a case study conducted in the Algerian Ministry of National Education’s English School Project-Based Learning (PBL) course books. The main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of PBL on English School projects. The findings show that PBL has a positive effect on English English projects, as it allows students to use what they learn in class to solve real-life problems. However, based on several studies that have been conducted in different regions in Algeria"
1334,"As a concern is growing about increasing socioeconomic polarization in South Korea (hereafter Korea), several studies have examined whether and how socioeconomic inequalities in educational outcomes changed over time during the past decades (Byun and Kim 2010; Byun and Lee 2021; Choi and Lee 2018). These studies document widening socioeconomic disparities in academic achievement (e.g., test scores) but declining socioeconomic disparities"
1335,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which began on March 16th 2020 and ended on July 21st 2021, has led to a dramatic change in people’s daily lives. Most notably, we spent more time at home, which led to other important changes – not only in terms of the activities we did, but also in when we did them. In many cases, the magnitude of these changes, occurring over a period of under two years, exceeds those observed over decades of historical change in time use behaviour. However, relatively little research has analysed changes in our main daily activities across all the main key phases of pandemic restrictions. Even less has been based on real-time time use diary data, the recognised �"
1336,"Economic, social and public health institutions rely on mortality forecasts to estimate, among other things, health care and disability costs, plan social security policies or estimate pension costs in an aging population. This entails a demand for robust and coherent forecasts for general mortality, but also for some components of mortality, such as causes of death. Forecasts by cause of death are confronted with different methodological problems and have often failed to provide coherent forecasts between components (Caselli and Vallin, 1996; Wilmoth, 1995). Oeppen (2008) proposed an elegant solution to this problem. He suggested abandoning the conventional way to forecast death rates and using Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA), pioneered by Aitchison (1986), in a forecasting"
1337,"The purpose of this article is to explore coronavirus memes, specifically reflecting social changes and attitudes during the stay-at-home phase of the pandemic. Memes can be a repository of emotional reactions in the face of a new health threat and also the illustration of change in social definitions and behaviours. Research conducted in 2016 by GFK Polonia and Clue PR shows that as many as 95% of users know what memes are, and 41% like to watch and share them online. According to respondents, memes are funny, 67% believe that they make fun, and"
1338,"Policies that provide paid leave benefits to new parents have become widespread and increasingly generous in most high-income countries in recent decades. Despite substantial interest from policymakers and the public, the academic literature has struggled to develop definitive evidence on the labor-market implications of parental leave policies - especially in the United States. Recent work has provided compelling evidence of the effect of paid leave on parents by drawing on variation in the generosity of benefits in California and a handful of other states where access to paid leave has long been nearly universal. However, much less is known about the implications of a national policy that alters parents’ access to parental leave on the extensive margin. Furthermore, while parental leave is designed primarily to benefit mothers and fathers, these policies"
1339,"Australia's public libraries serve vital roles within their communities. As the role of libraries and the needs of their users have changed, so, too, have the requirements of the physical library buildings themselves. The importance of public libraries’ physical spaces has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many users expressing how much they have missed visiting their local libraries, even when online and “click and collect” alternatives were available to them. A recent study indicated that these spaces were missed for a wide range of reasons, and at different levels: users missed various aspects of the atmosphere, library resources, as well as the numerous activities that they would otherwise have been doing in their libraries. This suggests that the design of these"
1340,"Life expectancy has continuously increased for over 200 years in most Western countries, with no visible limit (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002). Whether the extra years of life are being lived in good or poor health is of importance to society. As forecasts support social, economic and medical decisions, as well as individuals’ choices, there is a clear rationale for forecasting healthy life expectancy. However, forecasts of healthy"
1341,"There is growing evidence that direct interactions with the police can shape both situationspecific and global perceptions of procedural justice and legitimacy. However, survey research typically measures contact and experiences with police cross-sectionally and retrospectively (e.g., in the past 6 months to 2 years, Jackson et al., 2010; Kääriäinen, 2008). These retrospective measures are still limited in capturing the variety of experiences that may occur in daily life, and can be affected by recall biases wherein respondents forget incidents or characteristics of incidents, report incidents outside the timeline boundaries, or misinterpret the scope of the question. The current study explores the application of smartphone-based experience sampling techniques to measure experiences close to the moment that they occur."
1342,"School achievement is socially stratified (in the following referred to as the SES-achievement gap ) in all countries but there is substantial variation in the degree of stratification. In PISA 2018 social origin of children explains on average 14% of the variance in achievement in OECD countries. However, in some countries, social origin explains less than 8%, but in others almost 24% (OECD, 2019b: Table II.2.4). An important reason for these country differences might be differences in education systems, particularly whether and how students are assigned to different schools or courses. The earlier children are tracked to different"
1343,"This study explores the role of religion in American politics, specifically Christian nationalism, which is associated with support for gun ownership, expansive police powers, and other rights associated with conservative or libertarian ideologies. The findings show that white Christian nationalists are more likely to vote for candidates who support gun ownership rights and support for broad-based “freedoms” associated with “religious liberty” and “libertarianism,” particularly among white, native-born, conservative Christian men. In particular, they are associated with approval for rights that are culturally and historically connected with the project of whiteness including protection of gun rights (Du Mez 2020; Marti 2020; Whitehead et al. 2018) and voting"
1344,"In the US, transfer admissions are a popular process where students transfer between four-year institutions. These institutions are stratified by the types of degrees they can award as well as through their selectivity (community colleges have open admissions, four year schools do not) and economic opportunities (bachelors degrees often lead to higher paying jobs and are a prerequisite into high paying professional degree programs). Recent research has found that educational outcomes (ie. graduation rates after transferring) are stratifying by the direction of the transfer (lateral or reverse) and the academic pathway of the applicant: “lateral” for students transferring from a four year institution to a community college or bachelors degree granting institution; “vertical"
